### Theme of plenary session

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Critical Sociologist?**

There is significant unrest in today's society. Many are speaking out for or against current issues through protests, media, and online platforms—on topics such as climate change or the war in Gaza. Should sociologists engage more actively in public debate and share their political views? Or would this harm the image of science, and should sociologists instead aim to maintain a neutral and impartial position? How can we navigate the tension between striving for both value-free (objective) and valuable (socially engaged) science?

The keynote speaker — Thijs Bol, Nadia Fadil, Fenna van Marle, Irene van Oorschot — will share their experiences with us during the plenary session.

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> ***1. Geweld en (on)veiligheid (NL) - (open voor inzendingen)***

Don Weenink

Deze sessie biedt een podium voor Nederlands onderzoek naar verschillende vormen van geweld, intimidatie en veiligheid(sbeleid). Denk aan thema’s zoals institutioneel geweld (gevangenis, politie), geweld gepleegd door mannen tegen vrouwen (partner geweld, straatintimidatie), politiek geweld (terrorisme, intimidatie van journalisten en politici), geweld gerelateerd aan criminele economieën (drugs, milieugeweld) en de met deze geweldsvormen samenhangende politieke en beleidsmatige interventies. We verwelkomen daarnaast presentaties over theoretische kwesties zoals de rol van technologie en lichaam, de mate van asymmetrie tussen partijen en de temporaliteit van (opeenvolgende) gewelddadige interacties. Tenslotte zien we uit naar presentaties over de methodologische aspecten en innovatie van geweldsonderzoek. 

Trefwoorden: geweld, intimidatie, veiligheid(sbeleid)

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> ***2. Thinking-with and thinking-thick in co-creative research with marginalized communities (EN) - (open for submissions)***

Elena Ponzoni and Lise Woensdregt

This panel invites scholars studying topics related to inequality to reflect on co-creative methodologies for inclusive knowledge production, if possible, in dialogue with members of communities they engage with in their work, and relevant practitioners. The panel is organized by the Co-Creation for Inclusive Knowledges Lab at the Faculty of Social Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, which supports and connects (sociological) research engaged in reducing inequality. This initiative promotes co-creative methodologies that democratize knowledge production. By integrating community wisdom and experiential, professional, and academic knowledge, the lab facilitates productive exchanges that challenge exclusionary structures and foster transformative change. The panel draws inspiration from ethics of care in knowledge production as a core for co-creative methodologies. Puig de la Bellacasa (2012) presents care as a way of thinking and knowing by foregrounding interdependency and curiosity. For the scholar this means embracing vulnerability instead of positioning oneself as the knowing subject. She advocates for “thinking with”, which means standing for sustainable and vital relations with communities and creating conditions for co-creation of knowledges that will bring horizons together. This specific panel aims to highlight the transformative potential of bridging diverse forms of knowledge and the vital contributions of those navigating the intersection of communities and institutions. Together, we will reflect on how such approaches can drive meaningful societal change.

Keywords: Co-creation, marginalized communities, inclusive knowledge production

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> *3. Open Science: open-source software for advanced data analysis in sociology (EN) - (open for submissions)*

Mauricio Garnier-Villarreal, Marcos José Jiménez Henríquez and Terrence D. Jorgensen

Latent Variable Models (LVMs) are arguably one of the most powerful and flexible multivariate-statistical methods currently available.  Their scope includes a wide spectrum of statistical frameworks like Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), and Mixture Models (MMs). As such, they are considered the cornerstone of many statistical analyses encountered in fields like social, political, education, clinical and behavioural sciences. LVMs allow the test of theories where the subject of research involves nonobservable variables like cognitive skills, personality traits, and psychopathological features (in psychology), the modeling of attitudes and opinions (in survey research), the study of the evolution of complex phenomena like social and labour inequality (in sociology), and the validation of new teaching methods to investigate students' maturation in school (in education).

LVMs were first developed under a commercial software license. Closed-source proprietary software is available only to well-funded researchers, their code is inaccessible, and is often insufficiently documented for their results to be reproducible using open-source alternatives, violating the open-science principles of inclusion, equal opportunity, transparency, reproducibility, and accountability. Fortunately, some R packages have made LVMs freely available for the entire scientific community. 

LVMs’ popularity makes open-source software a critical infrastructure for open science. This project continues the lavaan project’s stated goal “to provide researchers and teachers a free open-source, but commercial-quality package for latent variable modelling”, supporting the open-science principles of inclusion, equal opportunity, transparency, reproducibility, and accountability. Here we will present the application of some LVMs on open-source R packages, like Social-Network data, Bayesian SEM, and Latent class Analysis.

Keywords: open-source, advanced data analysis

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> *4. Beleidsdrukte rondom vluchtelingen: wat levert het op? (NL) - (open voor inzendingen)*

Jaco Dagevos en Liesbet Heyse
 
Vluchtelingen verkeren de eerste jaren van hun verblijf in Nederland in wat wel een policy dense environment wordt genoemd. Als asielzoeker worden zij blootgesteld aan het opvangbeleid, na statusverlening zijn statushouders verplicht om binnen drie jaar in te burgeren en komen zij gespreid over het land te wonen vanwege het op statushouders gerichte spreidingsbeleid. In dit panel presenteren we onderzoek hoe het inburgeringsbeleid wordt uitgevoerd en welke gevolgen het opvang-, inburgerings- en spreidingsbeleid hebben voor het leren van de Nederlandse taal, de arbeidsmarktpositie en de uitstroom uit de bijstand. Daarvoor wordt allereerst een combinatie van register- en surveygegevens ingezet die inzicht geven in de effecten van dit beleid. Vervolgens bespreken we hoe via co-creatie met statushouders, werkgevers, gemeentelijke professionals en wetenschappers evidence-based interventies op regionaal niveau worden ontwikkeld om bij te dragen aan duurzaam en passend werk voor statushouders.

Trefwoorden: statushouders; beleid; taal en arbeidsmarktpositie

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> *5. European Social Survey – Insights from 12 years of data (EN) - (open for submissions)* 

Tim Reeskens

Fielded for the first time in 2002, the European Social Survey is a well-established source of data for social science researchers interested in explaining differences in relevant political and social orientations across countries or over-time. With its most recent release of round 11 data, the aim of this panel is to bring together scholars presenting and discussing the most recent findings. For this panel, we invite sociologists using the ESS to leverage insights from a comparative or longitudinal perspective. In addition, we welcome contributions on methodological innovations in studying public opinion using the ESS.

Keywords: European Social Survey, cross-national research, multilevel analysis

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> *6. Political Sociology (NL of EN) - (open for submissions)*

Willem de Koster, Marcel Lubbers, en Niels Spierings

This panel is open for quantitative, qualitative or mixed-methods sociological research on socio-political attitudes and political participation, both inside institutional politics (e.g. voting behaviour) and outside formal institutions (e.g. protesting). Presentations on political polarization, support for certain political attitudes, non-voting or specific voting preferences can, for instance, be part of this panel. Selected submissions may focus on differences in these outcomes between social classes, educational categories, genders, ethnic groups or other differences in relation to the social and political context. It offers a platform at the Dag van de Sociologie to bring together sociologists interested in the study of politics.

Keywords: voting, political attitudes, cleavages

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> *7. Mobilization on Display: Approaches to a Visual Sociology of Political Communication (NL of EN) - (open for submissions)*

Charlotte Bruns en Ofra Klein

With the rise and continuous influence of social media, visuals have become pivotal for political communication. The significance of visual elements is evident in the deliberate efforts of political parties, which enlist the expertise of professional graphic designers and advertising agencies to curate compelling visual content. Activist movements strategically choreograph actions to garner media attention, recognizing the potency of visuals in shaping public perception. Social media platforms facilitate the seamless upload of photos and live streaming during protests, rallies, and meetings, thereby empowering political actors and activists to construct a compelling visual narrative. Despite the growing impact of visuals in the political landscape, social science research has often overlooked their role. Scholars frequently neglect the nuanced ways in which visuals contribute to political communication.

This panel brings together scholars who work with visuals in their research. The aim is to discuss the heightened relevance of images in contemporary political discourse. By exploring different perspectives on visual politics, our discussion aims to shed light on the transformative potential of images, offering insights into their role in shaping political narratives and mobilizing public sentiment.

Keywords: visual sociology, mobilization, visual analysis

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> *8. How employers and institutions shape labour market inequalities (EN) - (open for submissions)* 

Dimitris Pavlopoulos and Stef Bouwhuis

Concerns about large and increasing labour market inequalities are growing. In many countries, wage inequalities are growing and workers face low job security, and limited opportunities to develop skills and knowledge. In some jobs, referred to as precarious, adverse characteristics such as job insecurity, low wages, and limited opportunities to develop are clustered. Recent research has indicated that firms, and the institutional context in which they operate, influence labour market inequalities since they often unilaterally determine employment conditions, e.g. wages and contract types. When deciding on these employment conditions, firms are influenced by their institutional context, e.g. labour market regulations and collective bargaining agreements. Previous research suggests that the decisions that firms make regarding wages and contracts affect job quality that employees experience, but may also have long-term effects on the well-being and mental health of workers. Therefore, it is important to better understand how workers are affected by the decisions employers make and how they experience being in precarious employment. The aim of this session is threefold: (1) gain insights into how employers shape employment conditions by the policies they formulate regarding wages and contracts for instance; (2) gain insights in how the institutional context matters; and (3) how labour market inequalities affect employees, in particular those in precarious employment.

Keywords: precarious work, collective bargaining agreements, labour market institutions

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> *9. Computational Sociology of the Low Countries (EN) - (open for submissions)*

Bas Hofstra, Rense Corten en Jochem Tolsma

The ever-increasing access to non-traditional data sources, new methodologies, and increased computing power is changing social science. Digital footprints left on social media provide unprecedented insight into networking behavior among millions of social relationships as they unfold; advances in natural language processing enable the substantive analyses of cultural expressions and social hierarchy in email exchanges among employees; and low-cost access to computing power now allows the study of wealth inequality with tax records of entire populations. Such studies would not have been possible without novel data, methodology, or computing power. Research like this has become known as “computational social science”.
 
This panel combines four papers under this denominator, yet we also welcome other papers on a variety of topics and methodologies. A common denominator is that papers A) use novel data sources beyond traditional social science methods and/or B) apply computationally intensive methods, but always combined with a societally and scientifically relevant question on culture, social relationships, or inequality. Papers can range – among many other approaches and topics – from massive online experiments on collaborative work to the text analyses of scholarly work to identify scientific innovation. As such, papers would ideally highlight novel tests of existing theories, or innovative tests of new theories made possible by some research design.

Keywords: Computational Sociology, digital footprints, machine learning

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> *10. Big data in sociological research (EN) - (open for submissions)*

Dimitris Pavlopoulos and Paulina Pankowska

In the last decades a growing variety of sources of big data has become available for sociological research. Big data is characterized by its high volume (the amount of data), velocity (the speed at which it is collected), and variety in data structures. Examples of big data include data from social media such as BlueSky, administrative data from National Statistical Institutes, and transaction data from companies, such as public transport use. Despite its potential, the use of big data in sociology comes with challenges as well. Issues such as representation, sampling and measurement error emerge in this data and often manifest differently compared to ‘traditional’ sociological data sources. In addition, accessing this data presents ethical challenges, while processing and analysing it is bound to computational issues. The aim of this session is to discuss the challenges and opportunities of the use of big data in sociological research. We do so by discussing: (1) different sociological topics for which the use of big data may be suitable; (2) different methods that are suitable to analyze big data; and (3) data quality and ethical issues related to the use of this data in sociology.

Keywords: Big data, digital trace data, data quality

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> *11. Prostitution and sex work: debate, risks and rewards in different institutional frameworks (EN) - (open for submissions)*

Stef Adriaenssens

Prostitution and sex work are contentious topics, even starting with the very words, How to indicate the buying and selling of sexual services (sex work or prostitution?) or those that are supplying these services (sex workers or prostituted persons?) is open to fierce debate. What is commonly called ‘prostitution’ is, indeed, both complicated and complex. Some related questions are downright moral, often boiling down to ‘Is prostitution wrong?’ while others are subject to empirical scrutiny. A lot of the debate is a bewildering mix of those ideal types. A substantive part of the discussion relates to agency, earnings, violence, market structure, gender composition, and other aspects that can be subject to empirical research. 

In the past decades, scholars have begun unravelling aspects of the functioning of prostitution markets with often robust and direct approaches. These contributions are scattered across multiple disciplines, but sociologists play a vital role. The session aims to take stock of recent progress in prostitution and sex work research, both localised in the Low Countries and globally, both in sociology and in multidisciplinary research. It aims to survey potential progress, start a conversation with different disciplinary contributions from the “sociological approach” perspective, and discuss whether such an approach makes any sense. 

The focus on the Low Countries is relevant, as the countries are laboratories of differing recent policy histories. In the early 2000s, the Netherlands changed their prohibitionist policy toward one usually indicated as ‘regulationist’, while Belgium only recently (2022) decriminalised its prohibitionist law.

Keywords: prostitution, sex work, social embeddedness

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> *12. Sociology of Music 1: The content of music, its impact and its future (EN)*

Pauwke Berkers and Julian Schaap

Sociological interest in music dates back to the birth of the sociological discipline, evidenced in the works of Max Weber, W.E.B. DuBois, and Georg Simmel. Contemporary cultural sociologists (Pierre Bourdieu, Howard Becker, Richard Peterson and others) have extensively studied music to address classic sociological issues as social inequality and cohesion. Indeed, Bourdieu famously argued that “nothing more clearly affirms one’s ‘class,’ nothing more infallibly classifies, than tastes in music” (1984:18). In their article in the Annual Review of Sociology, William G. Roy and Timothy J. Dowd (2010) demonstrate this wider sociological salience of the study of music, and show how it intersects with central sociological questions on social and social inequality and distinctions. 

This panel consists of four papers which each contribute – theoretically, methodologically and empirically – to a better understanding of these key issues in the sociology of music. All papers emphasize the content of music, from focusing the lyrics (Krsnik, Beočanin) to the impact of such lyrical themes on youngsters (Goverts) and the effect of technology on the content of music (Macała & Wijngaarden).

Keywords: music, lyrics, creativity

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> *13. Sociology of Music 2: The organization of music, its consequences, and ways forward (EN)*

Pauwke Berkers en Julian Schaap

Sociological interest in music dates back to the birth of the sociological discipline, evidenced in the works of Max Weber, W.E.B. DuBois, and Georg Simmel. Contemporary cultural sociologists (Pierre Bourdieu, Howard Becker, Richard Peterson and others) have extensively studied music to address classic sociological issues as social inequality and cohesion.

This panel consists of four papers which each contribute – theoretically, methodologically and empirically – to a better understanding of these key issues in the sociology of music. All papers emphasize the organization of music, focusing on how musicians justify their engagement with music platforms (Kroezen), festivalisation in relation to inequality (Calkins & Swartjes), the institutionalization of nightlife (Koren, Neiva & Tomescu), and transformative potential of seeds of change in the Dutch music ecosystem (Kimenai, Vervoort & Berkers).

Keywords: platformization, festivalisation, institutionalisation

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> *14. LGBTIQ+ inclusivity (EN)*

Saskia Glas, Wouter Kiekens and Niels Spierings

For decades the inclusion of lgbtiq+ people was steadily making progress across Europe and in the Netherlands in particular. Relatively recent there has been a developments towards a stronger focus on gender identity and non-heteronormative aspects of lgbtiq+ inclusion, organizations for instance paying more attention to lgbtiq+ inclusivity. At the same time, opposition to these developments has always existing, but more recently we see a clear rise of politicization of such forces and a growing ‘anti-woke’ sentiment, which also seeps into the political mainstream (i.e. the Dutch Liberal changing its stance a on sex registration law) and society more generally (i.e. the Dutch population becoming somewhat less progressive, particularly younger generations). And despite specific local configurations, elements of these patterns can be observed across the globe.

These development ask for new research. Existing explanatory and conceptual framework are potentially ill-fitted to explain the political, cultural and societal dynamics surrounding the diversity of lgbtiq+ and queer inclusion, the resistance against this and the consequences of those dynamics for individual queer people. Moreover, these – for some – unexpected turns of events raise new empirical questions, for which much or the existing repertoire (e.g. survey data) was not sufficient. 

Core to the observations and new questions discussed above is the interplay between the social, cultural and political context and the lives of individuals that have to position themselves, their well-being and their often contested identities in this context. In other words, a sociological perspective is crucial to understanding these developments and provide answer to the new questions. Luckily, across the country sociologist are currently working on this topic with innovative research and in this panel we bring together some of these studies to forge stronger connections, to cross-fertilize this research domain and to build stronger ties.

Keywords: sexual minority; gender minority, social context

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> *15. Tackling the Ethnic Gap in Higher Education (NL of EN)* 

Dounia Bourabain and Amal Miri 

Ethnic inequality in higher education (HE) remains a pressing societal challenge in OECD countries, with Flanders regarded as the “champion” of ethnic inequality in education. These disparities are evident in the underrepresentation, lower academic achievement, reduced well-being, and diminished belonging of ethno-racialized students compared to their majority counterparts. As higher education institutions face increasing diversity, addressing the structural-cultural factors behind this ‘ethnic gap’ is critical for fostering equitable learning environments. This panel brings together research that examines the multifaceted dimensions of ethnic inequality in HE, exploring innovative interventions to bridge this gap.

The panel showcases research from the FWO-SBO ENGINE project, a large-scale initiative aimed at understanding and mitigating the ethnic gap in Flemish HE. Employing co-creative research methodologies, the project develops a “Close-the-Gap” toolkit to help HEIs tackle systemic inequalities. The panel comprises four presentations exploring key dimensions of this challenge. The first examines the impact of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion policies on promoting diversity climates, assessing their effectiveness and influence on students’ diversity perceptions. The second focusses on professional development for educators, exploring how enhanced cultural awareness and intercultural skills foster inclusive classrooms. The third investigates ethnic minority student organizations’ role in academic success and belonging, using participatory action research. The fourth delves into the motivations, perceptions and choices of ethno-racialized students in joining various types of student organizations.

Together, this panel provides critical insights into the systemic barriers and enablers of inclusion in HE, offering actionable strategies for HEIs to create equitable environments for ethno-racialized students.

Keywords: higher education, inequality, ethnicity

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> *16. Mantelzorg (NL) / Informal care (EN) *

Ellen Verbakel and Alice de Boer 

De combinatie van een steeds groter wordende vraag naar langdurige zorg, ingrijpende hervormingen van de gezondheidszorg en tekort aan zorgpersoneel hebben tot gevolg dat er een groter beroep op mantelzorgers wordt gedaan. Deze ontwikkeling raakt mantelzorgers, zorgontvangers en zorgprofessionals op velerlei wijzen. In deze sessies onderzoeken we wat de toegenomen druk vanuit het beleid betekent voor (specifieke groepen) van mantelzorgers en wie er mantelzorg gaan verlenen; welke consequenties mantelzorgers en hun zorgontvangers ervaren, onder andere wat betreft welbevinden, werk en sociale relaties; hoe zorgnetwerken en samenwerking tussen de relevante actoren eruit zien; en hoe mantelzorgers ondersteund kunnen worden. Er is plaats voor kwantitatieve en kwalitatieve studies.

Trefwoorden: zorg, welbevinden, beleid

The combination of an increasing demand for long-term care, far-reaching reforms of the healthcare system and shortages of care personnel result in a greater demand for informal caregivers. This development affects informal caregivers, care recipients and care professionals in many ways. In these sessions, we examine what the increased pressure from policy means for (specific groups) of informal caregivers and for who will provide informal care; what consequences informal caregivers and their care recipients experience in terms of well-being, work and social relationships; what care networks and cooperation between the relevant actors look like; and what supports informal caregivers. We welcome quantitative and qualitative studies. 

Keywords: care, wellbeing, policy

*Vluchtelingen in Nederland: hoe vinden zij hun weg in een nieuwe samenleving en welke rol speelt beleid hierin? (NL) - (open for submissions)*

Jaco Dagevos

In dit panel wordt onderzoek gepresenteerd over hoe vluchtelingen hun weg vinden in Nederland, met bijzondere aandacht voor beleidsfactoren. Deze sessie informeert over verschillende onderwerpen. We krijgen inzicht in de opzet en uitvoering van verschillende typen onderzoek (etnografisch, observaties, focusgroepen, kwantitatief) onder vluchtelingengroepen. Daarnaast leveren de papers een beeld van verschillende vormen van beleid waarmee vluchtelingen te maken krijgen en, voor zover mogelijk, staan we stil bij de gevolgen hiervan. Nederland heeft een nieuwe inburgeringswet en in een van de papers wordt onderzoek gepresenteerd over de ervaringen van deelnemers met deze wet. Statushouders doorlopen een asielprocedure doorlopen en hebben een inburgeringsplicht. Dit geldt niet voor Oekraïense vluchtelingen. Ook bestaan voor hen geen belemmeringen voor toetreding tot de arbeidsmarkt. Een vergelijking van de positie van beide groepen kan meer inzicht bieden in de  betekenis van deze verschillende vormen van beleid. In deze sessie wordt een voorstel voor dergelijk onderzoek gedaan. Een ander paper gaat in op de relatie tussen de taalverwerving van Syrische statushouders en het Nederlandse opvang- en inburgeringsbeleid, daarbij gebruikmakend van longitudinale gegevens voor de periode 2015-2022.

*Mantelzorg in context (NL) - (open for submissions)*

Alice de Boer and Marjolein Broese van Groenou

De steeds groter wordende vraag naar langdurige zorg en de ingrijpende hervormingen van het zorgsysteem zorgen voor onzekerheid onder Nederlandse burgers. Zij vragen zich af of zij zelf of hun naasten nog wel de zorg kunnen krijgen die zij nodig hebben. Deze situatie is vooral uitdagend voor diegenen die zelf hulp bieden aan hun naasten, ook wel mantelzorg genoemd. Voor de pandemie was een op de tien mantelzorgers overbelast door de hulp die zij bieden en de verwachting is dat de druk de komende jaren zal toenemen en waarschijnlijk ook de belasting die hiermee gepaard gaat. Dit komt onder andere doordat er meer ouderen zullen zijn die behoefte hebben aan hulp, terwijl er minder mensen zijn die hen hierbij kunnen helpen, en van deze mensen ook verwacht wordt dat ze participeren in betaald werk of opleiding. Meer inzicht in belangrijke determinanten en uitkomsten van mantelzorg zijn nodig om huidige en toekomstige mantelzorgers goed te kunnen ondersteunen. Het verlenen en krijgen van mantelzorg is een afweging op individueel niveau, maar deze afweging is altijd geplaatst in de context van de familie, het werk en de (buurt)gemeenschap en de samenleving. In deze sessie komen papers aan bod die naar mantelzorg in verschillende contexten nader bekijken. Twee papers gaan over gevers van mantelzorg in de context van werk en de buurt. Twee papers gaan over ontvangers van mantelzorg, met aandacht voor het sociale netwerk en het welbevinden van de zorgontvanger.

*Sociology of Emotions (NL or EN) - (open for submissions)*

Aurélie Van de Peer and Mischa Dekker

While early scholarship on collective behavior tended to consider emotions solely through the prism of biology and contrasted them with rationality, the cultural turn in the social sciences brought attention to the cultural dimension of emotions. This body of work has emphasized that emotions are not simply biological reflexes nor experiential states that arise in a social vacuum; emotions are shaped by cultural understandings, norms, and processes of politicization. 

This panel welcomes papers that explore the role of emotions in any domain of social life (from education to culture, from law to media), including professional and private settings, online interactions, activism, and policymaking. We are interested in papers that address the intersectional dimensions of emotion: how are the ways in which people experience emotions informed by their race, class, and gender? And how do the ways emotional expressions are interpreted by groups of people vary across these lines and across various localized cultural settings? 

Moreover, the panel seeks to consider how emotions inform our understanding of gendered, racialized, and class-based inequalities. We welcome work that addresses the productive and inhibitive roles of emotions, encompassing both positively (happiness, pride, hope) and negative felt (shame, guilt, apprehension) emotions, as well as their impact on collective action, including activism and policy implementation.

Finally, this panel welcomes papers that aim to advance the theoretical aspects of sociology of emotions, for instance, by fleshing out the convergences and divergences with various humanities-inclined traditions in emotion studies.

*Prejudice, racism and exclusionary reactions towards ethnic and religious minorities (NL or EN) - (open for submissions)* 

Marcel Coenders and Michael Savelkoul

Against the backdrop of increasing ethnic and cultural diversity and growing concerns of polarization in public and political discourse on migration and diversity related issues, it is crucial to understand the patterns and antecedents of prejudice, racism and exclusionary reactions towards different ethnic and religious minorities and across different domains or contexts. This panel will bring together researchers on prejudice, racism, and exclusionary reactions, tackling these issues from various perspectives, theoretical backgrounds and methods. We welcome empirical studies and innovative theoretical perspectives of patterns and antecedents of prejudice, racism and exclusion within or across different social domains and contexts. We are particularly interested in papers that examine temporal aspects of prejudice, racism and exclusion and address their individual and contextual patterns and determinants. Among others, we welcome papers that investigate prejudice, racism and exclusion towards specific minority groups and/or across different minority groups. Additionally, we welcome papers that address the manifestation of prejudice, racism, and exclusion within specific social domains and settings (e.g. schools, neighborhoods, and organisations) and how challenges of increasing diversity are perceived and addressed within these specific contexts. Finally, we welcome papers that study the role of policies aimed at combatting discrimination and fostering integration, equity and inclusion.

*The Low Countries in Comparative Perspective: Results from International Surveys (EN) - (open for submissions)* 

Aat Liefbroer and Tim Reeskens


The Netherlands (and Belgium) participate in a number of international surveys. The European Social Survey (ESS), the European Value Study (EVS) and the International Social Programme (ISSP) focus on differences and trends in attitudes and values across Europe. The Generations and Gender Survey (GGS) focusses on changes in demographic and family behaviours. The Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) studies social change among older adults. In the Netherlands, all these surveys participate in and are funded by ODISSEI.
The aim of this session is to showcase research that can be done with these international surveys. In each presentation, comparative research based on one or more of these studies is presented. Focus of every presentation is to examine how The Netherlands (and Belgium) fare compared to other countries and to reflect on reasons for similarities and differences between the Low Countries and other parts of Europe.

Papers can range – among many other approaches and topics – from massive online experiments on collaborative work to the text analyses of scholarly work to identify scientific innovation. As such, papers would ideally highlight novel tests of existing theories, or innovative tests of new theories made possible by some research design.

*Ethnic, racial and religious discrimination: experimental designs and methodological innovations (EN)*

Valentina Di Stasio and Stefanie Sprong

In the past decade, a growing number of studies have relied on experimental methods to capture sensitive issues, such as discrimination on grounds of ethnicity, race and religion. Through a random allocation of ethnic and religious cues to fictitious applications (field experiments) or vignette-based scenarios (survey experiments), researchers have provided convincing evidence that members of minority groups face discrimination in the employment and housing sectors. In this panel, we discuss how aspects of the experimental design can influence the results obtained from field and survey experiments. 
The four studies included in the panel employ innovative methodological approaches that allow the authors to capture processes so far understudied, such as selective information acquisition from crucial gatekeepers (e.g. employers) or cumulative discrimination across life domains. In particular: Paper 1 extends the typical design of correspondence tests to the study of indirect discrimination in access to childcare; Papers 1 and 2 highlight the importance of pretesting experimental stimuli; Paper 3 introduces a novel technique (the click-to-reveal design) to minimize social desirability bias from respondents; Paper 4 reviews the operationalization choices made in previous research and their impact on the level of discrimination found in correspondence tests.

*Social Inequalities in International Higher Education (EN)*

Christof van Mol and Tijmen Weber

Higher education is rapidly internationalizing, but social inequalities in international higher education are still poorly understood. Nevertheless, the individual characteristics of students in terms of socio-economic background, gender, ethnicity, age, etc. can have a significant influence whether they take part in and benefit from internationalizing activities. Furthermore, on the country level, there are important differences in how far institutions are able to successfully internationalize and attract international students, and how socially inclusive they are. Understanding inequalities in international higher education is becoming increasingly important as higher education institutions are increasingly developing inclusive internationalization policies, which should be evidence-based. This panel presents a series of papers where inequalities in international higher education are highlighted, and their causes and consequences are discussed.

*Sociology of Music I: Audiences and Tastes (EN)*

Pauwke Berkers and Julian Schaap

Sociological interest in music dates back to the birth of the sociological discipline, evidenced in the works of Max Weber, W.E.B. DuBois, and Georg Simmel. Contemporary cultural sociologists (Pierre Bourdieu, Howard Becker, Richard Peterson and others) have extensively studied music to address classic sociological issues as social inequality and cohesion. Indeed, Bourdieu famously argued that “nothing more clearly affirms one’s ‘class,’ nothing more infallibly classifies, than tastes in music” (1984:18). In their article in the Annual Review of Sociology, William G. Roy and Timothy J. Dowd (2010) demonstrate this wider sociological salience of the study of music, and show how it intersects with central sociological questions on social and social inequality and distinctions. 

This panel consists of four papers which each contribute – theoretically, methodologically and empirically – to a better understanding of these key issues in the sociology of music. All papers emphasize the consumption of music, from focusing on arts participation (Calkins et al.) to interactions between musicians and audiences (Vandenberg and Dalla Chiesa) and from nightlife visitors (Hermans) to concert goers (Peters et al.). Calkins et al. take a classical Bourdieu-inspired topic – breadth of tastes – and add the dimension of race/ethnicity. Vandenberg and Dalla Chiesa look at the traditional practices of busking in the online age. Hermans examines how young, white, cisgender, and straight men negotiate masculinity in inclusive nightlife spaces. Finally, Peters et al. measure physiological and social well-being amongst concert visitors.

This panel consists of four papers which each contribute – theoretically, methodologically and empirically – to a better understanding of these key issues in the sociology of music. All papers emphasize the production of music, focusing musicians and bookers (Berkers & Wijngaarden), nightclub promotors (Koren), music managers (Calkins et al.), and musicians and policymakers (Mogoș). Yet, whereas Mogoș takes a historical approach, the other papers address the contemporary (Dutch) music industry. Berkers and Wijngaarden make an empirical contribution to studies of the gender pay gap in the cultural and creative industries, drawing on actual live concert fees. Koren draws on interviews with musical professional to make a methodological contribution. Calkins et al. have studied the understudied professional group of music managers. And finally. Mogoș sheds light on societal transitions through studying musicians and policymakers.

**Roundtables**


*Bring the mountain to us - sociology for sustainability scientists (EN or NL) - (open for submissions)*

Carien Moossdorff

Sustainability scientists need and want sociological theory and insights to help provide theoretical grounding for societal change processes towards a more sustainable future. As a sociological research group in a sustainability department, we have been getting a lot of positive responses from colleagues in the department, at sustainability conferences, and among stakeholders in the field. 

However, colleagues in the field of sustainability seem to have trouble finding sociology until we present it to them. This leads us to questions like: What is our responsibility as sociologists to share our theory? How do we retain the nuances of our field while presenting our insights in an accessible way? How, when, and why should we choose to be normative in our statements? 

During this roundtable, we will engage in a discussion on the opening up of sociology to sustainability researchers. We will bring in speakers from academic sociology, sustainability sciences, and the applied sustainability field. We are looking to have a freeform discussion with all participants on the topic of bringing sociology to sustainability fields.

*Collecting ethno-religious minority survey data in times of survey fatigue (EN)*

Niels Spierings and Nella Geurts

The Netherland have a long and strong tradition when it comes to collection survey data, both generally and using oversampling to assess the position of and attitudes among ethno-religious minorities, migrant citizens and their children. However, developments in survey collection (e.g. shift to online), in costs (AVG; monetary) and in society at large (e.g. the politicization on ethno-religious minorities; survey fatigue; covid-19 pandemic; institutional racism by the Dutch government) have lead to new realities and challenges. Maybe not surprisingly, several recent data collections among ethno-religious minorities have struggled to meet response targets and questions have arisen regarding selection and response biases. In this roundtable we tackle this issue.

Several scholars with recent experiences collecting survey data among ethno-religious minorities team up to (a) discuss the problems they run into and above all (b) what is needed to overcome these challenges. This discussion will be focused on real-life science. The focus is not on what would be ideal, but what can be done in the here and now or which steps are needed and can be taken to get closer to an ideal. 

Each speaker will very briefly start the round table by highlighting a main challenge after which this list is discussed in terms of solutions. The public will also be invited to contribute solutions and as a result of the round table we hope to work towards a roadmap.
