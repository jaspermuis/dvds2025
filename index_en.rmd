            var btn = document.getElementById("myButton1");
            //to make it fancier

**Climate Change - Where is the Sociological Research?**

Climate change is also a social issue. However, sociologists often seem absent within research consortia investigating climate change.

- Is this a concern?
- What could sociological research contribute?
- How can we initiate sociological research on the social issue of climate change?
- Are (many) sociologists hesitant about participatory action research?

Research into the causes and adverse effects of climate change requires a systemic approach. But what does that mean? We hope that the [keynote speakers](https://dvds2024.nl/programma_en) will inspire us. They will share their experiences within transdisciplinary research consortia.

[Ingrid Boas]( https://www.wur.nl/en/persons/ingrid-boas.htm) is an Associate Professor at the Environmental Policy Group at Wageningen University. Her research is based in the fields of environmental change, mobilities, and governance. In more detail, she researches the nexus between climate change and human (im)mobility, and how this manifests itself in plural ways in different parts of the world.  

In her keynote, drawing on results from her earlier Veni grant and ongoing Vidi grant on climate change-related mobility in the borderlands, she pays attention to the different ways in which the climate-mobility nexus is being framed and manifests itself, also politically. From the perspective as an interdisciplinary scholar, she will outline where she sees potential for a more sociological research lens in the field of climate mobilities research from the Netherlands and Belgium.

[Dr. Ann Crabbé](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/ann-crabbe/) is a senior researcher and member of the Research Centre on Environmental and Social Change of the University of Antwerp. She holds a master degree in public administration and a doctorate in political and social sciences. In her teachings and research she argues that the complexity of sustainability problems requires interdisciplinary collaborations. Together with biologist Sara Vicca she co-edited the book ‘Van Klimaatverandering naar Systeemverandering’.  

In her keynote she will talk about the nearly finished project SOLARIS in which she was involved. In this project a multi-disciplinary research group investigated social-spatial injustices of Climate Change Adaptation Policies in different countries. She will share the lessons learned on how to conduct multi-disciplinary research on climate change. She will share the lessons learned on how to conduct (and get funding for) multi-disciplinary research on climate change and the role sociologist can and need to play.

## Call for Papers

Dear colleagues,

On Monday, June 17, 2024, the 24th Sociology Day takes place in Nijmegen. This year, the conference will be organized by the Sociology department of Radboud University, in collaboration with the Dutch Sociological Association (NSV) and the Flemish Association for Sociology (VVS).

As of today, paper abstracts (max. 250 words) can be submitted via the NSV website (click [here](https://www.nsv-sociologie.nl/?page_id=3733&lang=en) for a direct link to the submission form). If possible, provide a concise description of the research questions, theoretical framework, methods and (preliminary) findings. When submitting, please indicate for which panel you want to apply. In addition to general panels, there are also various thematic panels, some of which are still open for abstracts. Papers that do not immediately fit within a theme can be submitted for the 'open panel. On the registration form you can indicate whether you want to present in Dutch and/or English. The organization strives for a good distribution of Dutch and English sessions. Authors can present a maximum of 1 paper themselves, but can be co-authors on multiple papers in the program.

Deadline for abstract submission has been extended to **March 28, 2024**. After the closing date, the abstracts will be assessed and assigned to a panel by the organizing committee. If your paper does not fit into the desired panel, we will try to place you in another suitable panel.

You will be informed in mid-April 2024 whether your abstract has been accepted and to which panel you have been assigned. All participants (speakers, panel chairmen, other interested parties) must then register via the NSV website to participate in the Sociology Day (this is possible from mid-April). Participation is not possible without registration and payment in advance.

Information on the Sociology day can be found at [www.dvds2024.nl](https://www.dvds2024.nl).
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at [dvds2024@nsv-sociologie.nl](mailto:dvds2024@nsv-sociologie.nl).

Please feel free to distribute this call to colleagues and interested parties. We are looking forward to your participation!

Best wishes, the organizing committee,

Nella Geurts, Bas Hofstra, Klara Raiber, Jochem Tolsma and Ellen Verbakel
