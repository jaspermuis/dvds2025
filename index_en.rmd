**The Critical Sociologist?**

There is significant unrest in today's society. Many are speaking out for or against current issues through protests, media, and online platformsâ€”on topics such as climate change or the war in Gaza. Should sociologists engage more actively in public debate and share their political views? Or would this harm the image of science, and should sociologists instead aim to maintain a neutral and impartial position? How can we navigate the tension between striving for both value-free (objective) and valuable (socially engaged) science?

The [keynote speakers](https://dvds2025.nl/programma_en) will share their experiences with us during the plenary session.

## *Call for panels*

As is annual tradition, the Sociology Day program consists of a mix of thematic panels. We would like to offer the opportunity to propose thematic panels to provide the opportunity for more specialized discussions and/or topics. This year there is a choice between a presentation panel and a round table panel. A full presentation panel consists of four paper presentations, preferably from at least two different universities or institutes. In a round table panel, a moderator will lead a discussion or exploration of a specific theme on the basis of (advanced) work by two to three researchers; different formats are possible. We are looking for a good mix of panels that are completely in Dutch and completely in English. 
 
Panel proposals must be submitted no later than Monday, January 27, 2025. Please complete [this form](Call for panels formulier DvdS 2025.docx) and send it to [dvds2025\@sociologie.nl](mailto:dvds2025@sociologie.nl){.email}.  
 
The panel chairs will be informed of the approval of their panels prior to the Call for Papers. 

The Call for Papers will be opened in early February.

Please feel free to distribute this call to colleagues and interested parties. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at dvds2025@sociologie.nl.

## Call for Papers

Dear colleagues,

On Monday, June 17, 2024, the 24th Sociology Day takes place in Nijmegen. This year, the conference will be organized by the Sociology department of Radboud University, in collaboration with the Dutch Sociological Association (NSV) and the Flemish Association for Sociology (VVS).

As of today, paper abstracts (max. 250 words) can be submitted via the NSV website (click [here](https://www.nsv-sociologie.nl/?page_id=3733&lang=en) for a direct link to the submission form). If possible, provide a concise description of the research questions, theoretical framework, methods and (preliminary) findings. When submitting, please indicate for which panel you want to apply. In addition to general panels, there are also various thematic panels, some of which are still open for abstracts. Papers that do not immediately fit within a theme can be submitted for the 'open panel. On the registration form you can indicate whether you want to present in Dutch and/or English. The organization strives for a good distribution of Dutch and English sessions. Authors can present a maximum of 1 paper themselves, but can be co-authors on multiple papers in the program.

Deadline for abstract submission has been extended to **March 28, 2024**. After the closing date, the abstracts will be assessed and assigned to a panel by the organizing committee. If your paper does not fit into the desired panel, we will try to place you in another suitable panel.

You will be informed in mid-April 2024 whether your abstract has been accepted and to which panel you have been assigned. All participants (speakers, panel chairmen, other interested parties) must then register via the NSV website to participate in the Sociology Day (this is possible from mid-April). Participation is not possible without registration and payment in advance.

Information on the Sociology day can be found at [www.dvds2024.nl](https://www.dvds2024.nl).
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at [dvds2024@nsv-sociologie.nl](mailto:dvds2024@nsv-sociologie.nl).

Please feel free to distribute this call to colleagues and interested parties. We are looking forward to your participation!

Best wishes, the organizing committee,

Nella Geurts, Bas Hofstra, Klara Raiber, Jochem Tolsma and Ellen Verbakel
