<p><a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/persons/ingrid-boas.htm">Ingrid Boas</a> is universitair hoofddocent bij de Environmental Policy Group aan de Wageningen University. In haar onderzoek richt zij zich op milieubeheer, mobiliteit en bestuur. Zo onderzoekt zij de relatie tussen klimaatverandering en menselijke (im)mobiliteit en hoe dit zich op diverse manieren manifesteert in verschillende delen van de wereld.</p>
<p>In haar keynote, zal ze putten uit resultaten van haar eerdere Veni-onderzoek en lopende Vidi-beurs over klimaatgerelateerde mobiliteit in grensgebieden. Ze besteedt aandacht aan de verschillende manieren hoe klimaatverandering gevolgen heeft voor mobiliteit en hoe de relatie tussen klimaat en mobiliteit geduid wordt, ook op politiek vlak. Vanuit het perspectief van een interdisciplinaire wetenschapper zal ze schetsen waar ze mogelijkheden ziet voor een meer sociologische onderzoeksaanpak op het gebied van klimaatmobiliteitsonderzoek in Nederland en België.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/ann-crabbe/">Ann Crabbé</a> is senior onderzoeker en lid van het Centre of Research on Environmental and Social Change van de Universiteit Antwerpen. Ann heeft een diploma kandidaat in de sociologie (1998), licentiaat in de bestuurswetenschappen (2000) en is doctor in de politieke en sociale wetenschappen (2008). In haar onderwijs en onderzoek pleit ze sterk voor interdisciplinaire samenwerking om de complexiteit van duurzaamheidsproblemen aan te pakken. Samen met biologe Sara Vicca was ze co-editor van het boek ‘Van Klimaatverandering naar Systeemverandering’.</p>
<p>In haar keynote zal ze onder andere spreken over het nagenoeg afgeronde project SOLARIS waar ze bij betrokken was. In dit project heeft een multidisciplinaire onderzoeksgroep sociaal-ruimtelijke onrechtvaardigheden als gevolg van klimaatadaptatiebeleid in verschillende landen onderzocht. Ze deelt de lessen die zijn geleerd over de praktijk van multidisciplinair onderzoek naar klimaatverandering en de rol die sociologen hierin kunnen (en moeten) spelen.</p>

Samen met Sara Vicca redigeerde ze het boek 'Van Klimaatverandering naar Systeemverandering'. Daarin stelt ze dat de oplossingen voor en aanpassingen aan de klimaat verandering van vele sectoren en disciplines moeten komen.

Those with a higher genetic propensity to spend more years in education were more likely to have engaged in forms of formal prosocial behaviours, i.e., blood donation, charitable giving and volunteer work. The polygenic score explained ~1% of the variance. We found no clear association between the polygenic score for years of education and informal helping. Shared environmental influences among siblings are responsible for about one quarter of the association between educational attainment and formal prosocial behaviour, and about half of the association between cognitive performance and formal prosocial behaviour.","Niet alleen overheden hebben bureaucratieën; ze zijn er ook in het onderwijs, de jeugdzorg, de gezondheidszorg, facilitaire bedrijven, de bouw en zelfs de sportvereniging en het zangkoor. Deze bureaucratieën zorgen regelmatig voor bureacratische overlast voor doelgroepen. Recente grote operaties 'tegen bureaucratie', zoals in de jeugdzorg en het onderwijs, leverden weinig op voor deze doelgroepen. Dat kwam mede door vage doelen, vage begrippen en gebrek aan effectonderzoek. Dat maakt de volgende vragen relevant:\n \n (1) Wat is bureaucratische overlast en hoe is hij te meten?\n (2) Wanneer en hoe zorgt een bureaucratie voor overlast en bij welke doelgroepen?\n (3) Waarom en wanneer zorgen bureaucratieën voor overlast?\n (4) Waarom en wanneer mislukt de aanpak van overlast en hoe kan hij wel effectief worden aangepakt?\n \n De Nederlandse sociologie heeft op dit terrein te lang stil gestaan. Dit paper geeft daarom een aanzet voor theorie en onderzoek. De uitgangspunten zijn:\n (a) Een bureaucratie is geen hiërarchische organisatie (zoals Weber suggereerde), maar een losvast netwerk van afdelingen en organisaties dat gezamenlijk consistente regelingen moet produceren.\n (b) Grootschalige bureacratische productie zorgt voor bijproducten: standaardisering, procedures en storingen.\n (c) De kwaliteit van een bureaucratie voor een doelgroep is het netto effect van zijn producten en bijproducten op de handelingsruimte van doelgroepen. Bij bureaucratische overlast is dat effect negatief.\n (d) Veel vormen van aanpak zijn voorspelbaar ineffectief. Doelgroepen kunnen bureaucratische kwaliteit wel verbeteren, maar alleen via eigenaren of eigendom.\n \n Dit paper geeft drie voorbeelden van de analyse van overlast en directe oorzaken: bureaucratische drempels (sushi), verwijsregelingen (dyslexie) en financiële regelingen (Toeslagenaffaire).","Inspired by the literature on ‘diploma democracies’, indicating that the overrepresentation of higher socioeconomic status (SES) politicians reduces lower SES citizens’ political trust and voter turn-out, we study the effect of civil servants’ SES background on how citizens relate to both civil servants and local governments. Given that today’s bureaucratic organizations are dominated by higher SES professionals, we use a pre-registered population-based vignette survey experiment to test whether (in)congruence between civil servants’ and citizens’ SES affects how citizens relate to civil servants and local governments. We expect that when there is a congruence between civil servants’ and citizens’ SES, citizens a) perceive more cultural proximity between themselves and civil servants, b) have more trust in civil servants and the local government, and c) are more willing to participate with civil servants and the local government. Our study therewith crucially advances our understanding of democratic (non-)participation, and provides a starting point for tackling the unwanted underrepresentation in all forms of participatory democracy of citizens with a lower SES.","Recently, there is an increased awareness that participation in volunteering is a dynamic process. Volunteering needs to be understood as occurring as part of a lifelong process of decisions made among changing circumstances, and is therefore best understood longitudinally. While this emphasis has reached the volunteering field, volunteering for humanitarian organizations seems to be overlooked. This is remarkable, since these volunteers distinguish themselves as they do not volunteer within, or for the benefit of, the in-group, but to help out-groups in society. Therefore, our study elaborates on panel data in which volunteers for humanitarian organizations are tracked over a period of fifteen years. In doing so, we seek answers to two research questions: 1) how many people start, quit or continue volunteering for humanitarian organizations over a longer period of time? And 2) which life course transitions are associated with starting versus quitting volunteering for humanitarian organizations? In order to answer our questions, we took advantage of high-quality panel data derived from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS). We depart from a resource-based approach in which we unravel what forms of capital, i.e., life course transitions related to human capital, social capital and cultural capital, play a role in the likelihood to start or quit humanitarian volunteering. In doing so, we take a unique approach by examining the relationship between transitions within the life course of individuals and transitions in and out of humanitarian volunteering. Moreover, we advance on related studies with only a cross-sectional design.","Since mid-twentieth century, rates of overweight and obesity have risen tremendously in children and adolescents. One group at risk for developing overweight or obesity includes children and adolescents in single-parent families. However, the increased risk of being overweight or obese for children and adolescents in single-parent families is much stronger in some European countries than in others. The aim of this study is to examine two potential explanations for these cross-national differences. On the individual level, we hypothesise that social support by family, friends, classmates, and teachers reduces the association between living with a single parent and the likelihood of being overweight or obese. On the national level, we hypothesise that high levels of national school-based health promotion reduces this association. For this study, we use survey data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) dataset on adolescents aged 11 to 15 from 44 countries and their family structure, body mass index (BMI), and perceived social support. We complement the HBSC dataset with WHO data on national-level school health programmes and policies. We conduct mixed multilevel logistic regressions with respondents clustered in countries and schools and being overweight or obese as a binary dependent variable. Our preliminary results confirm that living with a single parent increases the likelihood of being overweight or obese. We do not find evidence that social support reduces this association; results on the moderating effects of school-based health promotion are soon expected. \n \n Keywords: overweight, obesity, single-parent families, social support, school-based health promotion, survey data\n","Er bestaat consensus dat bewegen en sporten (de ontwikkeling van) symptomen van een slechte mentale gezondheid kunnen tegengaan. Deze relatie wordt belangrijker nu er in de afgelopen jaren wereldwijd aandacht is voor de slechte status van de mentale gezondheid van jongvolwassenen, met de COVID-19-pandemie als hoogtepunt. De jongvolwassenheid, van 18 tot 34 jaar, wordt beschouwd als een statusovergang in de geïnstitutionaliseerde levensloop, waarbij verschillende rollen- en statusveranderingen betrokken zijn, geleid door leeftijdsgerelateerde informele en wettelijke normen. De stap van voltijdsonderwijs naar de arbeidsmarkt is van cruciaal belang in deze overgang. In het onderwijs ervaren jongvolwassenen vaak nieuwverworven autonomie en vrijheid. Jongvolwassenen die werkzaam zijn, hebben daarentegen meer financiële vrijheid maar zijn minder flexibel met hun tijd en ervaren vaker stress. Het starten met werken lijkt dan ook een overstap te veroorzaken van teamsport naar individuele sport, aangezien deze over het algemeen minder tijdsintensief en meer flexibel zijn. Om bestaand beleid rondom de verslechterende geestelijke gezondheid van jongvolwassenen optimaal te benutten, is het essentieel om de relatie tussen (typen) sportdeelname en geestelijke gezondheid gedurende de transitie van school naar werk te begrijpen. Wij onderzoeken daarom: In hoeverre wordt de relatie tussen de tijd die jongvolwassenen besteden aan sport en hun mentale gezondheid gemodereerd door het hebben gemaakt van de overgang van school naar werk? En hoe verschilt deze relatie tussen het besteden van tijd aan teamsport en aan individuele sport? Hiervoor maken we gebruik van informatie uit twintig edities van de cross-sectionele Nederlandse Gezondheidsenquête 2001-2022.","Despite the association of certain attitudes and worldviews (e.g., religiosity, trust in authorities) with non-vaccination behavior, some individuals holding these attitudes still choose vaccination, and vice versa. This study aims to explore why individuals chose to get vaccinated against COVID-19, despite holding opposing attitudes and worldviews (i.e., positive deviants), or refrained from vaccination, when their attitudes aligned with vaccination (i.e., negative deviants). By examining these atypical individuals, we seek to identify new roads to develop interventions to improve vaccination uptake. We conducted semi-structured online interviews with 21 Dutch adults in 2022. Interviewees were recruited based on their answering patterns in a survey that was part of a larger project on understanding vaccine hesitancy in the Netherlands. Positive deviants got vaccinated because they perceived COVID-19 as a threat, wanted to protect others, or wanted to regain their freedom. Negative deviants did not get vaccinated because they did not perceive the vaccine as appropriate, the disease not as threat, for religious reasons, or did not trust the authorities. The most important factors that could improve vaccination uptake were related to characteristics of the vaccine, such as effectiveness and side-effects. This study demonstrates that traditional models (e.g., Health Belief Model) can be applied to explain deviant vaccination behavior. Furthermore, the findings suggest that vaccination uptake might be promoted by promoting the collective benefit and imposing restrictions on non-vaccinated individuals. As some individuals will remain resistant to vaccination, tailored interventions for vaccine-hesitant individuals may yield greater success rather than attempting to persuade strict opponents.","This study explores the challenges faced by individuals with a migration background in Belgium's healthcare system, focusing on medical decision-making (MDM). We intend to examine two primary challenges: (1) preferences for information disclosure and (2) responsibility in MDM. In Belgian healthcare, the law and ethical codes mandate clear disclosure of diagnoses and prognoses, yet migrant patients from collectivistic cultures often prefer limited information or truth concealment, sometimes favoring family involvement over direct patient communication. Additionally, these populations may prefer family-centered decision-making, contrasting with the emphasis on patient autonomy in Belgian medical practice. Our research specifically investigated these aspects of MDM among the three largest migrant groups in Belgium—Maghreb, Turkey, and Sub-Saharan Africa—through three focus groups comprising patient representatives and healthcare workers with a migration background. The aim was to understand the unique preferences and challenges these groups face in MDM across various contexts, including critical versus chronic care, decisions with severe versus less severe consequences, and choices concerning physical versus mental health disorders. Preliminary findings indicate distinct preferences and challenges within these migrant groups, which vary significantly based on the nature of the medical situation. This study highlights the importance of culturally sensitive healthcare practices to accommodate the diverse needs of migrant populations in medical decision-making processes.","Since overconsumption is a main cause of environmental degradation, it is crucial to understand consumption patterns in our society as a shift to a sustainable way of consumption can make a relevant difference. Despite ongoing interest in exploring background factors (such as socioeconomic status, SES, and normative influence) that influence consumption, several critical gaps persist in our understanding. First, while research on the effects of separate SES components on consumption is abundant, comparatively little is known about their interplay, that is, whether the effects of one SES component (e.g., income) on consumption are contingent upon other components (e.g., education). Second, most consumption research examines different consumption behaviours in isolation, which may lead to an inaccurate estimation of one’s environmental impacts as not all consumption behaviours are equally subjected to SES and normative influence. To address the research gaps, we will explore the effect of the interplay between income and education on a multiplicity of consumption concerning fashion, food, transport, water, and energy, as they are the primary sources of individual carbon contribution (Center for Sustainable Systems, 2023) and are likely to be differently related to SES and normative influence. Utilizing CBS microdata (Statistics Netherlands, 2015), we will run a latent class analysis to identify consumption profiles according to peoples’ expenditures. We will then explore whether the profiles can be characterized by people’s income and education level. Our study can offer nuanced insights into the consumption profiles in the Netherlands and the role of background factors in consumption more broadly.","The question of whether individuals incorporate climate change considerations into their reproductive decisions has emerged as a significant area of inquiry. Research in this field predominantly follows two trajectories: exploring the influence of extreme weather events on fertility planning, and investigating the relationship between self-reported climate change concerns and (often concurrently stated) fertility intentions. This study advances the existing body of research by leveraging individual-level panel data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) conducted between 2009 and 2020. The UKHLS provides information on a nationally representative cohort of approximately 50,000 individuals in the UK. We focus on two primary predictors: belief in climate change and self-reported pro-environmental behaviours (reported in waves 1, 4, and 10). The outcomes are fertility intentions and preferences regarding the number of children (reported in waves 1, 5, and 10). We execute the analyses in consecutive steps, with the main aim of uncovering whether any potential cross-sectional associations are present when more robust approaches to modelling the theorized causal links are applied. All analyses are run separately for men and women and for parents and non-parents at first observation. Our preliminary findings suggest that while there are some cross-sectional associations, particularly with pro-environmental behaviors as predictors, these do not hold when adjusting for essential covariates or employing person-fixed effects models. We reflect on these findings by discussing the narratives that people might employ to make sense of their fertility preferences in a society where the transition to parenthood is still seen as a key milestone.","Household behaviours play a pivotal role in shaping global greenhouse gas emissions, especially in industrialised countries. However, little research has yet investigated how the collective actions and consumption patterns of household members contribute to these emissions. One important factor is gender, as previous research showed large disparities in the carbon footprints of men and women. A few studies indicate that women living in single-person households tend to exhibit less carbon emissions than men, which is in line with the norms and values associated with gender (Druckman et al., 2012). In contrast, women living in multi-person households tend to exhibit more carbon emissions than men, which is in line with gendered differences in household and care work (Smetschka et al., 2019).\n However, little studies have yet investigated potential explanations for such complementary findings. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the carbon emissions of men and women by taking into account the complex interactions that shape carbon emissions of multi-person households differently than the emissions of single-person households. Specifically, we argue that the carbon gender gap in multi-person households originates from the way that carbon emissions were attributed to the different household members without recognising that many of the activities predominantly performed by women, benefit other household members as well. By disentangling action-based from benefit-based carbon emissions, we hope to provide a more realistic understanding of individual carbon emissions across genders in the Netherlands. This distinction sets the groundwork for subsequent research into the intra-household dynamics that underlie collective sustainable consumption practices.","This presentation focuses on the analysis of the visual identity that Extinction Rebellion NL (XR) creates on Instagram. XR is a global environmental movement advocating for urgent action against climate change. Through a visual analysis of XR's visual content, this study reconstructs how visuals contribute to the movement's image and its mobilization strategy. XR's iconic symbol, the hourglass within a circle, serves as a starting point, embodying the urgency of time running out. The XR activists organize protests, where distinctive visual elements, such as vibrant colors, creative banners, and theatrical performances, play pivotal roles in capturing public attention and fostering a sense of collective identity. Additionally, the use of visual idioms of liminality, civil disobedience and hedonistic party culture form a subversive image that is visually striking and creates visuals that are effectively covered by a diversity of media outlets. By employing comparative visual analysis and drawing on sociological frameworks, this research contributes to our understanding of the symbiotic relationship between visual communication, activism, and the mobilization of public sentiment.","For centuries, mankind has thrived on the use of fossil fuels (e.g., oil, coal, gas). However, the presence of a changing climate has compelled us to reassess our dependence on these finite resources. The looming and already existing threats of climate change in combination of finite resources necessitates a turn towards more renewable, or green, energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydroelectric). This has led governments and international cooperations to propose laws and regulations that either restrict and limit the use of fossil fuels or encourage the implementation of alternative energy sources. While these policies already had an impact in the use of fossil and renewable energy sources, it is less clear what public opinion perceives as the ideal ‘energy mix’ – is there massive support for renewable energy for the energy supply, or are people of the opinion that traditional nonrenewable sources should remain dominant? The aim of this paper is to explain what Dutch public opinion perceives as the ideal energy mix. Relying on Seemingly Unrelated Regression techniques on a unique wave of the LISS panel, we can disentangle traditional economic arguments and value based explanations in the explanation of why some put more emphasis on nonrenewable than on renewable energy sources.","In my book, A Sociology of Humankind (2024), I synthesize different strands of conflict literature, using networks as a common denominator, resulting in a general computational model. Here, I apply it to the global climate problem. At the root of the problem, wealthy investors in fossil fuel industries constrain billions of people by deteriorating the natural environment. These constraints enter discourse in terms of controversial issues, and their controversialness increases with constraint. If controversialness remains below a critical threshold, which co-depends on the network topology, investors and other citizens can reach a working consensus and resolve their conflict of interest. If controversialness rises above the critical threshold, however, people radicalize to various degrees, ranging from Extinction Rebellion at one extreme to resisting elites and commoners with vested interests at the other extreme, resulting in a polarized society. Will disgruntled citizens act collectively?\n \n Standing in the way of collective protests and climate-saving interventions are (1) the loose connections between climate activists across the world, (2) the lack of norms, selective incentives, and other mechanisms to self-enforce collective actions, and (3) the global legitimacy of nationalism: one (e.g., poor) country does not have the right to interfere with another (e.g., rich) country's climate measures. Consequently, effective collective actions seem unlikely. Nonetheless, collective action is possible if people become sufficiently agitated, e.g., by heat, pollution, or propaganda. At a critical level of agitation, cooperation will break out, but it might be too little too late.","Worldwide, we are already witnessing the catastrophic impacts of climate change. Floods are among the most common climate-related disasters, with a fairly recent and nearby example being the flood events in Belgium, Germany, and parts of the Netherlands in July 2021. Managing these risks is ever more necessary. However, flood risk management (FRM) is often understood as a technical challenge. This is problematic, because FRM inherently involves decisions about the distribution of resources and risks in floods, which can be unfair. People are disparately affected by floods due to their socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, impacting their capacity to prepare for, endure, and recover after floods. These differences need to be recognised in FRM to prevent disproportionate impacts on vulnerable communities. This paper therefore examines recognition of differences in the capacity of people to deal with floods in FRM in England (United Kingdom), Finland, Flanders (Belgium) and France. We analyse if, and how, capacity differences are recognised in FRM policy and practice and through decision-making procedures, drawing on examples from the implementation of five FRM strategies in each country (flood risk prevention, flood defence, flood risk mitigation, flood preparation and flood recovery). At present, discussions on recognition justice are scarce due to a dominance of engineering expertise. A knowledge gap remains on how to make FRM more inclusive and just, which can be solved by the input of sociological perspectives. The paper also highlights opportunity spaces to strengthen recognition justice in future FRM.","Heartfelt discontent takes hold of the Dutch countryside, culminating in various protests over the last years, causing quite a rumble throughout various layers of Dutch society. To connect to the scholarly question of how to understand different forms of resistance to the ‘agricultural crisis’ and to inspire the increasingly urgent policy challenge to transform the food system in order to fight climate change and biodiversity loss, this paper delves into varying cultural repertoires – thereby going beyond the ‘peasant-entrepreneur dichotomy’ – and more explicitly acknowledges different expressions of farmer resistance. We do so by using representative Dutch data, collected in the summer of 2020, during ongoing Dutch farmers upheaval and demonstrations. We show how farmers’ protests can only partially be understood as a populist movement and confirm a growing differentiation of cultural repertoires in Dutch agriculture, in which work experience outside of agriculture by both men and women is a factor of importance. As such, the survey results suggest that Dutch farmer demonstrations conceal populist forces as well as concrete promises for a more sustainable agriculture.","Currently, due to the environmental impacts of meat, a major challenge is a societal transition towards more plant-based consumption. While chefs’ innovative craftsmanship marks them as potential change agents in such a transition, their agency is limited due to the nature of the established practice of eating out and its diverse carriers, such as restaurant diners. This paper aims to understand the tensions between this practice and changing discourses on meat and plant-based consumption. Using Shove’s concept of ‘infusing’, the paper examines how such discourses infuse this meat-heavy practice and more specifically, how the intertwinement between discursive and routinized elements in practice either supports or hinders meat reduction. Drawing from 23 interviews with head chefs of French/Western restaurants in the Netherlands, preliminary findings reveal how discourse on plant-based consumption infuses the practice of eating out in several ways, such as through culinary giants going plant-based and coordination between head chefs and more plant-based-oriented apprentices. Regarding forms of resistance, serving and eating animal products in restaurants is normatively acceptable and expectable, as exemplified by the ongoing popularity of meat dishes and the fear of bankruptcy after cutting meat off the menu. Taken together, the embedment of ideas about meat and plant-based consumption into the practice of eating out both facilitates and complicates meat reduction in restaurants. This paper contributes to the literature on social practices in transition; it specifically delves deeper into the underexplored territory of the practice of eating out in the context of the animal/plant transition from chefs’ perspectives.","People’s perceptions about others play an important role in social influence processes: If people misperceive others, these misperceptions might shape their own behaviors and attitudes. Recent research suggests that many people are unduly pessimistic about the pro-environmental engagement of other people and that the majority think that they are “greener than average”. Such misperceptions could inhibit pro-environmental change. This study examines whether people hold such misperceptions also about proximal referends, while previous studies focused on large, abstract reference groups. We report results of a network study in which friends nominated by ‘seed respondents’ (university students) were also invited to complete the questionnaire. Seed respondents as well as their friends provided information about themselves as well as their perceptions of each other. Results show that people tend to see themselves as greener than their friends.","This study investigates the perceptions of sustainability policies among less-educated citizens in the Zuid-Holland region of the Netherlands. In this explorative qualitative research, I used in-depth focus-group interviews with 58 participants to explore sustainability-policy perceptions amongst less-educated citizens from a sociological perspective. With this study three distinct evaluations of sustainability policies were identified. With this research three different policy evaluations were identified. The first evaluation highlights the perception of unfairness in policy design. Sustainability-policies are evaluated as unfair because they disproportionately benefit financially powerful entities, while citizens with limited resources cannot fully participate in sustainable living due to inadequate subsidies. Secondly, sustainability-policies are evaluated as insensitive because the interviewees experience a cultural distance which fuels their perception of policymakers as insensitive to their lived-experiences. Lastly, sustainability policies are experienced as ineffective, focusing both on policy design and implementations due to a lack of sustainable mindset amongst citizens and inconsistent policy decisions as a consequence of the fragmented Dutch political landscape. I conclude this research paper with recommendations for future research and implications for impactful sustainability-policy design.","In this study, we use the “losers and winners of globalization” thesis (Kriesi, 2008; Teney, et al, 2014) to explain opinions on environmental concern. We focus on both economic and cultural “losers”. First, economically marginalized groups might experience problems keeping up with the political and societal debate on acting against environmental changes. For example, while individuals of higher socioeconomic status are often willing to pay for green energy alternatives, lower socioeconomic status groups experience difficulty financing these often-pricey investments, making them feel less concerned about the environment.   Second, individuals with a weaker cultural position are often relegated to the margins of society because of their inability to keep up with developments in a highly globalized world. As there is a worldwide call for acting against changing climate, followed by international regulations to tackle these issues, the cultural “losers” may backlash against this.\n These two forms of misrecognition can be linked to feelings of resentment which are often part of nationalist rhetoric and, in the political arena, combined with an ‘anti-climate action’ stance. In our research we therefore try to disentangle the two perspectives of the economic and the cultural “losers” of globalization and link it to feelings of nationalism. Our main goal is to study the impact of the national context on these relationships and test if they are stronger in more globalized countries. To test our ideas, we employ multilevel analyses on data from ISSP 2020 (28 countries).","Dit onderzoek onderzoekt de relatie tussen cultuureducatie en het welbevinden van jongeren met een migratieachtergrond in Vlaamse cultuurhistorische musea. Sinds de educational turn in de tweede helft van de 20e eeuw willen musea hun maatschappelijke rol meer concreet gaan invullen en ontpoppen zij zich in toenemende mate tot alternatieve leerplekken. Musea hebben echter moeite met het bereiken van adolescenten. De groeiende diversiteit, de steeds snellere generatiewissels en de invloed van nieuwe technologieën zorgen voor uitdagingen tussen jongeren en musea. De collecties waar musea over beschikken, dragen vaak een narratief uit waar jongeren met een superdiverse achtergrond zich niet in herkennen. Een beperkt herkenbare representatie in musea kan leiden tot verminderde interesse en betrokkenheid van deze jongeren, waardoor het waarborgen van hun welbevinden tijdens museumbezoeken cruciaal is. De studie onderzoekt hoe musea en scholen kunnen tegemoetkomen aan de cultuureducatieve behoeften van deze leerlingen. Via kwalitatief onderzoek en theoretische analyse, inclusief casusanalyses met jongeren tussen 14-18 jaar in het Museum Dr. Guislain, MSK en het Industriemuseum in Gent wordt aangetoond dat naast het gezin ook het onderwijssysteem een significante rol speelt bij het bevorderen van cultuurparticipatie. De analyse richt zich op de percepties van de jongeren met betrekking tot de toegankelijkheid van musea, ondersteund door Bourdieu's kapitaaltheorie. Verder roepen de bevindingen vragen op over de effectiviteit van bestaande educatieve benaderingen en benadrukken ze de behoefte aan een meer doordachte en afgestemde cultuureducatie. Concrete aanbevelingen benadrukken de noodzaak van een inclusieve aanpak door scholen en culturele instellingen om de culturele kloof te verkleinen.","Although scholars such as Bourdieu and DiMaggio have theorized on the relationship between cultural capital and network diversity, there is limited empirical evidence to back these theories. Building on recent studies on the conversion value of cultural tastes (e.g. Lizardo), we advance these notions by theorizing on how various aspects of cultural capital relate to educational network diversity. That is, depending on one’s educational level, we hypothesize that different forms of cultural capital have a contrasting effect on educational network diversity. For instance, for higher educated people, we expect that particularly popular cultural capital increases educational network diversity, as this is at odds with the conventional cultural taste in this group. Conversely, we theorize that for lower educated people mainly highbrow cultural capital is positively related to educational network diversity. As previous studies have hardly studied explanatory mechanisms for these relationships, our second contribution is that we study whether educational belonging explains these relationships between cultural capital and educational network diversity. Lastly, we innovatively put forward that the relationship between cultural capital and educational belonging is moderated by educational mobility, i.e. it might be stronger for stable versus mobile individuals. Based on LISS-data (2023), we test our hypotheses with structural equation modelling, for which we will apply Multiple Group Modelling. With our prospective results, we explicitly address previously untested mechanisms to provide new insights into how (various aspects of) cultural capital, educational belonging and mobility shape network diversity for both higher and lower educated individuals.","This study operates at the intersection of cultural sociology and consumer culture to investigate the mechanisms through which sneaker collectors in the Netherlands assign meaning to their collecting practices and how this process shapes and maintains their sense of self. Furthermore, the article sheds light on the changing dynamics of contemporary collecting, particularly in response to the perceived loss of enchantment resulting from the convenience offered by online marketplaces. By analysing 20 in-depth interviews, the study identifies five distinct typologies among sneaker collectors: expressionists, social collectors, art enthusiasts, completionists, and hunters. In relation to identity formation, expressionists and social collectors use sneaker collecting as a way to do identity work, either on an individual or collective level. Art enthusiasts, on the other hand, find meaning in the aesthetic judgment of the intrinsic qualities of the object. Finally, completionists and hunters demonstrate the most engagement with market dynamics, as their motivations are influenced by these market dynamics, and their strategies revolve around navigating the implications of the reseller market and online marketplaces. Artificial scarcity and exclusivity often enhance their collecting practices. However, they strategically employ self-imposed limitations to attain a sense of closure or engage in a more meaningful hunt, thereby reintroducing a sense of enchantment into their collecting practices. \n","In this study we investigate how majorities’ perceptions of the prevalence of ethnic discrimination are associated with various forms of interethnic contact. We propose that interethnic contact provides majorities with information about the frequency of discrimination of ethnic minorities, which leads to thinking that ethnic discrimination is more prevalent. While the literature has pointed to interethnic contact as a promising pathway to understand when majorities acknowledge racial discrimination, empirical research on this association is scarce, provides mixed results and does not differentiate between different forms of contact. We provide a detailed picture of these different contact forms by distinguishing between interethnic friendships, positive interethnic contact at work or in the neighborhood. We simultaneously control for negative experienced interethnic contact. We further explore how these associations between interethnic contact and majorities’ perceptions is dependent on majorities’ general attitudes toward ethnic minorities. This enables us to distinguish the information from the affective component in the assumed relationship. We employ data from the SOCON 2022, a recent national survey from the Netherlands which provides plentiful data on interethnic contact. Preliminary results show that, against expectations, more interethnic contact is not significantly related to majorities thinking that ethnic discrimination is more prevalent in the Netherlands. A possible explanation is that ethnic inequalities and discrimination have to be discussed extensively for it to be associated with majorities’ perceptions of discrimination. We do find that majorities’ attitudes towards ethnic minorities are associated with their perceptions of the prevalence of ethnic discrimination.","This paper investigates support with which diversity policies in hiring are met within organizations. Specifically, I study differences in support between employees who are targeted by diversity policies (in this case ethnic minorities and women) and employees who are not. Hiring policies are one powerful tool that organizations use to decrease discrimination and hire a diverse set of employees. Despite organizations’ increased attention to and implementation of diversity policies, discrimination in hiring is stable. May this be due to a lack of support for diversity policies among an organization’s employees? While the literature has engaged with policies that attempt to make hiring non-discriminatory, research that addresses support for diversity policies within organizations is limited. This is surprising, as the literature suggests that a diversity policy which is endorsed within organizations is more effective in increasing diversity. In this paper, I focus on the ‘target group’ hypothesis and explore whether support for diversity policies within organizations differs between target- and non-target groups. I investigate if differences in support are driven by distinct perceptions of deservingness - are the target groups perceived as discriminated against at the organization and hence deserving of diversity measures? Additionally, I explore resource threat of the non-targeted group and the target groups’ possible fear of ‘stigma of incompetence’.\n The research design employs a novel conjoint experiment from The Netherlands, that assesses employees’ (N=1200) support for introducing sets of new hiring policies at their organizations. Policies vary between identity-blind and identity-conscious measures and differ in formalization levels.","The existence of ethnic discrimination in the hiring process has been repeatedly confirmed using field experiments that confront real employers with fictitious applicants. However, the conditions that exacerbate or alleviate hiring discrimination have received surprisingly little attention by researchers. We study one such condition that might affect ethnic discrimination in hiring: employers’ attitudes towards immigration and diversity. \n Using data from a nation-wide field experiment in Germany, we, first, confirm previous research on ethnic discrimination in hiring by showing a hiring gap of 7 percentage points between German and Turkish applicants. Second, we study the relationship between anti-immigrant attitudes of employers and ethnic discrimination. Given that it is difficult to obtain direct information on employers’ attitudes from field experimental data, we use three angles to approximate employer attitudes. First, we look at local election results as a proxy for anti-immigrant attitudes. Second, we determine firms’ commitment to diversity by evaluating texts from job advertisements. And, third, we apply a survey questionnaire to a subset of our field experiment sample that gives us the opportunity to study recruiter attitudes directly. \n","Highly educated minority individuals perceive more ethnic discrimination than their less educated counterparts, a finding known as the “integration paradox”. Despite being well-established, research on the theoretical mechanisms underlying the integration paradox yields inconsistent results. In this paper, we build on one specific mechanism, relative deprivation, which concerns frustration and unfairness feelings triggered by the difference between expectations and disappointing outcomes. By examining trajectories of educational aspirations and disparities between desired and achieved education levels, we aim to establish a causal connection between education and the perception of ethnic discrimination. We argue that previous studies have overlooked the process of aspiration formation: aspirations at time t depend on previous (un)successful investments in education at time t-1. Uncovering the causal impact of relative deprivation on perceptions of discrimination thus makes it imperative to incorporate aspirational trajectories to mitigate reverse causality concerns. Our study distinguishes between first and second-generation immigrants, acknowledging their distinct ways of forming aspirations. Leveraging longitudinal data from Spain, the Longitudinal Study of the Children of Immigrants in Spain, we span an 8-year period across three waves, repeatedly collecting information about educational aspirations, attained education, and perceived discrimination. Using fixed-effects models, accounting for prior discrimination perceptions and aspirations, we test whether and how blocked aspirations translate into perceptions of discrimination.","“Even an extra five pounds can hurt your job chances”, as read in a heading of The Washington Post in 2016. Studies have illustrated that fat people face discrimination in employment settings, healthcare facilities, and educational institutions. Prejudice towards fat people plays a key part in these processes, yet little is known about its causes. Considering the vast amount of studies on various types of intergroup relations, it is surprising that research on prejudice towards fat people is relatively scarce and often primarily approached from a health or psychological perspective. Sociological research is however lacking. By exploring prejudice towards fat people among a representative sample in the Netherlands, this study builds on existing research that is mainly based on highly selective samples among student populations. This enables us to fill existing knowledge gaps on the omnipresence of prejudice towards fat people. Moreover, this study is the first to examine how educational attainment – one of the key predictors of intergroup attitudes – affects prejudice towards fat people. To assess how and when educational attainment plays a part, we explore how educational attainment intersects with contact with fat people and one’s perception of their own fatness.  We hypothesize that contact with fat people and self-identifying as fat hamper prejudice towards fat people and can decrease educational differences in this type of prejudice. We use data of the Social and Cultural Developments in the Netherlands survey (SOCON) 2020, which includes unique items of the existing fat phobia scale, to test our hypotheses.","Information and communication technology (ICT) have become indispensable in contemporary schools in post-industrialized countries. Whether schools have succeeded on vesting students with the needed digital skills important in today’s highly digitalized societal landscape however remains unclear. In this paper, we examine whether school resources in terms of ICT infrastructure, use of ICT in education, and availability of technical expertise are pertinent to students’ digital skillfulness. We also investigate whether such school ICT resources are unequally distributed among students of different socioeconomic backgrounds, and whether students of different socioeconomic backgrounds unevenly benefit from these resources. In doing so, we illuminate school ICT resources’ role in the process of intergenerational transmission of inequalities. To test our expectations, we employ ICILS 2018 data on 14,183 students in 751 schools across seven OECD countries. Our findings, from multilevel SEM analyses, indicate that schools indeed play a meaningful role in nurturing digital skills, namely through students’ use of ICT in educational tasks. We also find that students from more advantageous socioeconomic backgrounds more often attend well ICT-resourced schools, pointing at the uneven distribution of school ICT resources in a way that reflects social reproduction. Alongside that, the availability of technical expertise in schools seems particularly fruitful for low-SES students’ digital skills development. This evinces that schools also compensate for limited ICT skills socialization in the family, pointing at social mobility processes. School ICT resources do nurture ICT skills but also concurrently augment and alleviate digital skills inequality.","A lack of higher education institutions reachable from the parental home is associated with youth obtaining less educational qualifications and/or migration to places with a better offer of study programmes. In this case study, we focus on the Dutch province of Flevoland where two events – the opening of a train line and a sudden expansion course offerings – drastically expanded the number of study programmes reachable for local youth. We aim to provide causal evidence on how such an increase in reachable study programmes alters local youth’s study choices and internal migration. The offer of higher education programmes in Flevoland has historically been low, as there is no university and the universities of applied sciences only offered a small range of programmes. During our study period from 2005 to 2017, the local universities of applied sciences suddenly increased their course offering while the opening of a train line increased the reachability of study programmes within and outside the province. We use Dutch register data to track cohorts of graduates of secondary school in their decisions to enrol in higher education and to move to a different municipality. To estimate our effects, we use a difference-in-differences approach combined with matching to compare outcomes of local youth in Flevoland with youth in areas where the reachability of higher education remained low and stable over time. Our tentative results show that, against expectation, these events did not reduce migration to other municipalities, while showing small and inconsistent effects on educational choices.","Evaluating policy programs in the educational field can be challenging due to the methodological issues and the complex structure of the educational landscape. This research uses CBS microdata to estimate the effectiveness of an extended school week intervention in Rotterdam South. The intervention is one of the main pillars of the National Program Rotterdam South (NPRZ) and aims to improve test scores and primary school advices in approximately 30 primary schools. We show how synthetic control methods can be applied to estimate the causal impact of the intervention in different schools. Synthetic control methods can estimate the effect of interventions that are implemented at an aggregate level affecting a small number of large units (including schools), on some aggregate outcome of interest (Abadie, 2021). We discuss the application of synthetic control methods in the educational field and possible advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we consider the implications of the results for the extended school week intervention.","Reported trends show concerning developments in the health and academic performance of youth worldwide, as well as in the Netherlands. Whether these developments are related is uncertain, because we lack representative data that include information on both health and school performance in the Netherlands. The National Cohort Study on Education (NCO) has good data on all publicly funded schools in the Netherlands about school performance of pupils’ school trajectory and about their social background. These data are stored at Statistics Netherlands (CBS), and are available under strict conditions for researchers to perform scientific research. However, this dataset lacks information about relevant health aspects and behaviour. \n \n Therefore, we are collecting new data in the EPoSS project in 2024 of 4000 pupils in the Netherlands in primary and secondary education. This will provide a unique dataset of mental and physical health, health behaviour, as well as social environment and school experience. We will consequently link it to the individuals’ school performance and social background in the NCO data. This way, it will be possible to investigate the (predictive) links between social background, health, lifestyle and school performance. Consequently, the EPoSS dataset contributes to new, efficient research on children’s education and health in the Netherlands, and on the role of health in the social reproduction of inequalities in educational opportunity. In this paper, we present this new data source and inform the research community about the opportunities offered by the data.\n","Ethnic, racial and religious minorities often experience discrimination in multiple life domains, which accumulates across the life course. Correspondence tests are a reliable way to measure the extent of discrimination, yet existing research in this area still primarily focuses on the labour market and typically does not take into consideration the cumulative nature of discrimination. In the current study, we therefore focus on discrimination towards Black, Muslim and Roma families in access to childcare in nine European countries, thereby also taking into consideration how (the absence of) success in the domains of housing and employment might spill over to childcare. In the study, we send over 10,000 emails to childcare providers across nine countries, in which we ask for a childcare spot and randomly vary the name of the fictitious sender as well as other relevant characteristics. Before running these field experiments, we test the perceptions of the names and pre-test the other experimental manipulations. The first results show that there is substantial variation in the extent to which names that are common among these minoritised groups are perceived as Muslim, Black and Roma, and that the novel experimental manipulations that signal success in other domains are noticed by readers. The actual field experimental data will be collected in March and April 2024.","Experimental discrimination and bias studies, using correspondence tests, implicit association tests or vignette experiments, are increasingly aware of the signals, names contain. Previously, names were used as a proxy signal for ethnic origin, without thorough internal validation of those names. Although people infer ethnic origin from names, it has also been shown that signals of inter alia gender, age, religiosity, and socio-economic status are perceived. So far, studies analysing this focus either on the American context, or a specific European country. This study aims to compare the perceived signals in names over nine different European countries: Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Switzerland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. To do so, we analyse the perception of 1.008 names among a representative sample of 3.240 respondents. Hereby, signals of ethnic origin, gender, religiosity, and social class are considered, enabling us to indicate names with a strong internal validity for each country to be used in experimental research designs. ","Conjoint analysis is a widely applied survey experimental technique to estimate the causal effect of multiple treatment variables simultaneously on an outcome variable. However, while conjoint experiments are ideal for studying respondents’ preferences, they do not give insights into the respondents’ information-seeking behavior leading to their final choices. In addition, although the conjoint design is believed to elicit lower social desirability bias (SDB) compared to other survey experimental techniques, little research studies SDB in conjoint designs. Building on work in marketing studies, we introduce a discrete choice experiment to the field of social sciences: the click-to-reveal (CTR) conjoint. The CTR conjoint allows respondents to reveal a limited number of conjoint attributes, but not all. By tracking which attributes respondents reveal, the CTR assesses the importance of information in making a choice. In addition, we expect SDB to be lower in the CTR conjoint because it captures stated preferences more indirectly, and because the choice is based on the subset of attributes that is selected by the respondent. We collected data from an online sample in the United Kingdom (Prolific, N=2200) and presented respondents with a scenario that is prone to SDB: a simulated hiring decision testing for ethnic discrimination. We benchmark the CTR against a regular conjoint and compare the importance weights and the parameter estimates of the attributes.","Since the early 2000s correspondence studies have increasingly been used to study ethnic and racial discrimination. These types of studies are often considered the “gold standard” because they offer robust evidence of discrimination which does not suffer from social desirability bias. However, correspondence studies can differ greatly in how they operationalise the treatment and control groups, potentially driving differences in call back rates. In this study, we first discuss the concept and operationalisation of race and ethnicity in the context of correspondence studies, before exploring how existing studies have operationalised race and ethnicity and how this might have impacted the results. Using a dataset of 143 correspondence experiments, we collected data on researcher decisions such as: use of implicit cues such as foreign-sounding names, or explicitly stating ethnicity in the application, whether signals are placed in CV or personal letter, procedures for name choice and pretesting, and inclusion of connected signals such as religion or SES. The analysis consists of a descriptive overview of current practices and specification curve analysis of point estimates of callback gaps over signaling choices. ","The majority of 2nd generation immigrants in Western Europe identify both with the ethnic group of their parents and the national majority group of the country they grew up in. Yet, many feel that they are not recognized as members of the national group and are instead misclassified as only ethnic minority members. According to the rejection-identification model, such feelings of identity denial can lead to a re-orientation toward the minority group and hostility toward the majority. \n \n Using unique social network data, we test for the first time whether perceived identity denial is the result of actual identity denial among peers. Students in vocational education in the Netherlands (N = 460) reported their ethnic/national self-identification and indicated to which ethnic or national groups they thought each of their classmates belonged. We explore to what extent 2nd generation immigrants who self-identify as belonging to the majority group are misclassified by their peers as ethnic minority members (misclassification indegree). Using multilevel structural equation models, we then test to what extent perceptions of identity denial mediate effects of actual identity denial on (1) perceptions of discrimination, (2) feelings toward the Netherlands, and (3) prejudice toward the Dutch. In the last step, we test whether friendships with majority peers (structural integration) moderate the effect of the misclassification indegree on perceived identity denial. This paper advances the field by comparing for the first time perceived to actual identity denial and by highlighting how structural integration can prevent negative consequences of identity denial.\n","While a considerable body of literature has studied ethnic inequalities and discrimination in Latin America, just recently, there is a growing number of studies examining income inequalities by race, defined as a skin color gradation. Furthermore, most research equates ethnic self-identification with race, leading to confusion on the root of the discrimination. Only a few studies have addressed ethnicity and race as separate but intertwined characteristics to examine income disparities. This scarcity is particularly evident in the Latin American context, given the dominant role miscegenation played in the region and the heavy impact that it has had on the racial fluidity of its people. Hence, in this paper, I employ data from the Americas Barometer to investigate race and ethnicity income gaps in 17 Latin American countries. To do so, I applied non-linear regressions and decomposition methods, which allowed me to (i) separate the observable and non-observable factors of the income gap and (ii) decompose them by race and ethnicity and look at their intersection. In addition to the principal analyses, I conducted a series of robustness checks to evaluate the results' consistency and perform heterogeneity analysis to examine income inequalities per country. The analyses' results show substantial differences in the average income of the different ethnic and racial groups, mainly driven by differences in observable characteristics like years of education and employment status. In addition, the heterogeneity exercises indicate that ethnic and racial disparities vary across Latin America and can be explained partially by unobserved variables like discrimination. Overall, the results suggest that skin color and ethnic self-identification should be accounted for simultaneously when evaluating inequality.","The migrants’ remittances to their country of origin have received ample academic attention. However, the remittances of refugees are relatively understudied. Given the increasing refugee inflow over the past years, and the importance of these remittances for the origin country, more scientific knowledge about the remittances of refugees is needed. This paper aims to test whether refugees are more or less likely to send remittances than other immigrant groups. On the one hand, refugees are more likely to remit to assist their families in need in their country of origin. On the other hand, given the precarious situation in the country of origin, they are less likely to return and thus more likely to invest in the destination country. Furthermore, given their fewer economic resources in the Netherlands, refugees are less likely to remit than other immigrants. To test these competing hypotheses, we will analyze large-scale survey data containing 4000 refugees and 3000 immigrants among ten origin groups. The richness of these data allows us to not only test the difference in remittances between refugees and immigrants but also the mediating role of return intentions, and economic- and sociocultural integration, using Structural Equation Modelling.","Across Europe, an increasing group of retired migrants often spends their retirement in poverty. Individual immigrants have little influence on a country’s retirement institutions (pillar 1), and the pension they accrue via their employer (pillar 2) is largely driven by the disadvantaged positions that immigrants often have on the labor market (Drouhot & Nee, 2019; Heath, 2008). Therefore, I study the third pillar of retirement income: how often do different groups of migrants save for their retirement?\n A handful of studies shows that migrants generally save less than natives due to well-documented differences in their economic conditions (e.g., (Amuedo-Dorantes & Pozot, 2002). It remains unclear to what extent these findings also extend to retirement savings – given the lower pensions of migrants, their incentive to save is particularly strong here. I hypothesize:\n 1)\tMigrants save less often for retirement than natives\n 2)\tEuropean migrants save more often for retirement than non-European migrants\n 3)\tSecond-generation migrants save more than first-generation migrants, but less than natives\n 4)\tThe younger someone migrated, the more often they save for retirement\n \n I use multilevel data on 21 European countries from the European Social Survey, wave 3. Preliminary results show that saving behaviour of European migrants is comparable to non-migrants, and that non-European migrants save substantially less. This is true for the first as well as the second generation.\n \n","Fertility below the replacement level is considered an urgent societal issue in large parts of the world, fueling policy makers' concerns about population aging, shrinking workforces and an increasing care burden. The decline to low fertility is particularly pronounced in East Asia, which has been explained by the conflict there between women’s high rate of educational attainment and labor force participation on the one hand and traditional attitudes towards women’s domestic roles on the other. This incompatibility of public and private roles is experienced especially strongly by people with egalitarian gender attitudes, who, as a result, are more likely to postpone or forgo births compared to people with traditional views, making gender attitudes a relevant factor in explaining fertility behavior. A particularly interesting context in this regard is China, which recently abandoned its one-child-policy, but has not witnessed pronounced increases in fertility rates since, thereby spurring scholarly interest in understanding the determinants of higher order births in the Chinese context. This study examines the transition to an additional child based on the gender attitudes of both partners in 2,708 Chinese couples using longitudinal data from the Chinese Family Panel Studies collected between 2014 and 2020. We use logistic regression models to predict the birth of an additional child by the gender attitudes of both partners and the dissimilarity between them as well as relevant control variables pertaining to socio-demographic status and factors of particular relevance to the Chinese context such as the sex of previous children and the Hukou.","Contraceptive preferences are evolving in Belgium, with a noticeable increase in critical perspectives among women regarding modern contraceptive methods, such as hormone skepticism. Moreover, within heterosexual relationships, women are more aware of the greater burden of responsibility for contraception and managing its side effects. Consequently, there is a growing demand to explore avenues for equalizing contraceptive responsibility and developing more personalized contraceptive options for men. \n This study therefore aims to qualitatively research how both men and women in Belgium experience the process of choosing a contraception method, if this is accompanied by mental burden, and how more possibilities concerning male contraception would change this.  \n These topics will be discussed in 9-12 group conversations with sexually active adults without a current pregnancy desire., in every Belgian region (Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia). Additionally group interviews with people with a low socio-economical background will be organized if they are not represented in the general groups. The group interviews will be guided by a questionnaire focusing on peoples ‘lived experience’, and the interviews will be recorded, transcribed ad verbatim, and coded inductively and thematically. \n Having a better view not only on which contraceptive methods people prefer, but also why they do or do not want to use certain methods is valuable for both policy makers and health professionals involved in contraception counseling, family planning, etc. The results of this qualitative research could inform future contraception campaigns and provide guidance in contraception counselling and in developing more gender equal policies concerning contraception.\n","It has frequently been assumed that relationships formed after prior union dissolution tend to be less stable than first-time relationships. However, the extent to which there might be a difference between the dissolution probability of first-time relationships and relationships after prior union dissolution likely depends on the criteria one uses to define a relationship. For example, does one only consider marriage, or any form of living together with a partner? Do both partners have a prior marriage/cohabitation relationship, or just one of them? Do both or just one of the two partners have children from a previous relationship, or neither?\n Using longitudinal register data from the Netherlands, we estimate the union dissolution probabilities for four relationship cohorts (2007-2010) over a ten-year timeframe using discrete-time logistic regression. \n Our findings suggest that, overall, relationships after prior union dissolution do bear a higher risk of dissolution than first-time unions – especially when both partners have children from a previous relationship – but that relationship definitions matter. For example, marriages tend to be the least stable when both partners were previously married, whereas cohabitation relationships were more stable when both partners previously cohabited. Socio-economic characteristics – such as age, income, or education levels of the partners – only account for a small part of these differences.\n","During the last decades, care work of fathers has received an upsurge of scholarly attention within social and pedagogical sciences, especially because Dutch fathers and mothers aspire to more work-care equality. With the implementation of the EU Work-Life Balance directive the Dutch government has implemented more extensive legislation for paternity and parental leave to facilitate the process of a more equal care division. The premise is that policy measures influence care behaviour, and vice versa. We therefore expect to see a change in work-care behaviour between different generations of fathers. \n \tTo better understand this discrepancy between care behaviour on the one hand and care ambition and work-family policy on the other hand, this paper focuses on the question who adult sons see as ‘role models’ in their work-care attitudes and work-care behaviour.  Moreover, we looked at the intergenerational transmission of work-care attitudes and behaviours between fathers and their independently living adult sons in the Netherlands. We conducted paired-depth interviews with fathers and sons about how work-care ambitions and behaviour are passed down across generations, and how they are influenced by their environment. \n Based on a first round of analysis, our findings concur with previous research describing intergenerational role modelling as a selective, partial and uncertain (subconscious) process. Our preliminary findings suggest that fathers draw from a palette of ‘fragmented role models’ in order to construct their work-care behaviour in accordance with what is (or was) feasible for them and their environment at a given moment in time. \n","This research delves into the experiences of children navigating the dissolution of stepfamilies, focusing on the impact on their mental health. Existing studies predominantly adopt a retrospective approach or explore long-term consequences, overlooking the critical period of the divorce itself. Acknowledging this gap, the study leverages data from Awel, an organization providing support to children and youth (6-25 years) facing various life challenges.\n In 2022 alone, Awel facilitated 22,165 interactions, with a notable portion related to familial struggles. This study employs a qualitative in-depth analysis of chats and emails between Awel and children specifically addressing the challenges arising from the dissolution of stepfamilies.\n Initial examination of the data reveals two distinct perspectives on the dissolution of stepfamilies. The first perspective centers on relief, where children express hope for the dissolution. For some, the separation brings relief, because they still harbor dreams of their parents reuniting, facilitated by the absence of parental relationships. These children seek support during their time within the stepfamily.\n The second perspective revolves around stress, capturing the experiences of children who successfully integrated into the stepfamily. For these individuals, the disruption of their established family life becomes a significant stressor. Awel receives most contacts from this group during the dissolution phase, as they seek guidance on navigating the aftermath of a second dissolution.\n This study aims to provide a nuanced understanding of children's perspectives during the dissolution of stepfamilies, shedding light on both the relieving and stressful aspects of this complex phenomenon.\n","There is a remarkable rise in the visibility of transgender and gender-non-conforming individuals in the Netherlands. Current scientific research surrounding this topic often limits its own scope of analysis by prescribing a collective group identity to these individuals. Combining queer constructivism with feminist theories of embodiment, this qualitative semi-structured interview study aims to account for the distinct lived experiences of transgender and gender-non-conforming participants as embodied, self- constructed, and socially-constructed. Despite a few similarities, findings point to significant differences in the lived experiences of transgender and gender-non-conforming respondents.","The recent literature on gender role attitudes (GRA) in western societies suggests that after achieving greater egalitarianism the upward increase in GRA has plateaued. However,  evidence of this plateau remains scarce globally, especially within Islamic societies. In this paper, we examine the nature and degree of change in GRA within Pakistan, a nation undergoing the two contrasting processes of modernization. On one hand educational expansion has consistently unfolded over past decades, while on the other hand the country has exposed to religious revival, particularly during the 1979-1988 Islamization period, making the direction of change unpredictable. A comparison is made across cohorts born from 1945-1994 using a pooled cross-section analysis of the World Value Survey (WVS), with Pakistan participating four times (1997-2018, N=5400). Drawing from modernization theory, we incorporate education and religiosity as mediating variables between birth cohort and GRA in our design, assuming cohort replacement predominantly influences the link between education, religiousness and GRA. Viewed across all birth cohorts we find that later born cohorts, on the whole, exhibit greater egalitarianism. However, contrary to the hypothesis of generational change, we find a trend reversal in GRA for cohorts born after 1975, who were more conservative. While education substantially mediates GRA, religion shows only a minor effect. Notably, the backlash in GRA cannot be explained by an increased religiousness induced by Pakistan’s Islamization since the early 1980’s.","Despite developments in workplace equality, gender differences in career advancement persist to this day. While segregation within and across job types and gender role beliefs are established explanations of this inequality, social networks in and outside work play a crucial role as well. Through social networks, the resources of others can be mobilized and used for career advancement. This paper investigates the link between social support (career support and emotional support) provided by an individual's social network and individual career advancement. Prior research suggests, that men and women differ in their social networks, especially concerning network composition, but potentially also in terms of resource returns from their networks. For this reason, we investigate whether or not social support is equally beneficial for the career advancement of men and women, taking gender as a moderator into account. We use data from the SOEP 2019-2021 which provide information on support networks of individuals together with career advancement measured in the subsequent years. Given the nature of the network item, we aim to also investigate whether and to what extent the source of support (e.g., colleagues/supervisors) is of importance. The findings of this study hold implications for addressing gender-based career disparities.","Research suggests that homemakers may have better mental health compared to employees, as juggling multiple social roles like work, caregiving, and parenting can lead to stress. Having one role less —the role of an employee—could potentially benefit mental health. The existing literature on the mental health implications of prolonged homemaking is scarce. An exception is the study by Langner (2022) that made a debut in taking the duration of homemaking into account. However, like most studies, they did not include men, despite more than 100 thousand stay-at-home parents in the Netherlands being male. We contribute to the literature by investigating the disparities in mental health between homemakers and working individuals, while considering gender and the duration of homemaking.\n \n We use unique longitudinal register data covering the entire Dutch population from 2005 to 2021 and fixed effects models to follow individuals’ (non-)employment trajectories and mental health. Institutions like the World Health Organization emphasize the importance of enhancing mental health. We extend prior research that primarily focused on happiness and life satisfaction, by employing more objective indicators such as mental health care service usage and prescribed antidepressants. Moreover, the rich register data allow us to consider homemakers within their broader context, incorporating characteristics of partners and potential children. \n \n Keywords: Dutch population data, gender, homemakers, life course perspective, mental health \n \n Langner, L.

Rwanda has employed efforts to bridge the gender gap in many aspects of life including education. Despite the efforts to bridge the gender gap in STEM fields, women remain underrepresented, particularly at higher levels of education and in STEM-related careers. Therefore, recognizing the complicated dynamics shaping female students’ engagement with STEM is essential for developing positive strategies to encourage their participation and engagement in these perceived male-dominated fields.\n Drawing upon an extensive review of existing literature and newly collected survey data from Rwanda, this study investigates how sociocultural factors, such as societal norms, gender stereotypes, family economic status, access to resources, career prospects, peer perceptions, and educational environments shape self-confidence, perceived gender stereotypes in STEM and STEM aspirations for 14 to 18-year-old female students.  Data were collected among a representative sample of 914  Schools in kayonza district, a disadvantaged district in Rwanda. Multiple regression analysis will be used to analyze the data and examine the relationship between social-cultural and economic factors and the dependent variables while controlling for other potential variables. \n The study findings are expected to inform educational policymakers, educational stakeholders, and parents for targeted interventions and support mechanisms to stimulate high school female students to aspire to learn and excel in STEM education therefore, contributing to the greater gender inclusion in STEM.\n Keywords: High school female students, social-cultural e","In recent years, scholarship on arrival infrastructures has refocused attention to the importance of the local level as the main site where the social in- and exclusion of newcomers is negotiated. Compared to other newcomers, undocumented migrants face especially daunting legal obstacles in the process of contesting their exclusion and negotiating their inclusion. In this article, we rely on ethnographic research at the Pauluskerk in Rotterdam to argue that Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs) operate as migration infrastructures that facilitate this process locally for undocumented migrants. FBOs are uniquely placed to provide undocumented migrants access to resources because they have been historically constituted as spaces of sanctuary that test the limits of state sovereignty. On the one hand, we demonstrate that FBOs mediate access to material resources via participating in Bed, Bath and Bread programs and helping undocumented migrants to navigate the urban informal economy. On the other hand, we show that FBOs provide immaterial resources by connecting undocumented migrants to social networks, stimulating a sense of belonging and setting up bureaucratic firewalls. Extending the lessons learned from this case study, we argue that FBOs need to constantly navigate the symbolic space between formality and informality when engaging in infrastructuring activities towards undocumented migrants to stay true to their mission. At the same time, our findings indicate that the unique role that FBOs play as ‘safe havens’ in a hostile political environment can come under pressure as local governments increasingly seek to incorporate their efforts into local reception policies.","In literature on political representation, citizens with a migration background are often studied as a homogeneous group, with ethnicity as their most important identity. However, previous studies have shown that there is diversity between and among minoritized citizens with a migration background in their experienced representation. We argue that intersections of several identities may be an important driver of experienced political inclusion and the differences among citizens herein. Furthermore, and equally important, we shift the attention to self-assessed identities. While previous quantitative studies have often scrutinized differences between citizens based on categorized identities under the assumption that these characteristics and their intersections are influential for their identities, we study the role that identification plays in explaining representation. For instance, the fact that someone is categorized as a woman with a migration background does not mean that their gender and migration background are salient for their identity, which may influence the way they perceive members of parliament with (un)shared identities and thus their experienced political representation.\n \n The current study delves into the role that identifications (e.g. identification with gender) play in experienced political representation. Applying an intersectional perspective to mechanisms stemming from literatures on social identities and political representation, we derive hypotheses on which ethnic minorities feel more represented politically and the role that identification plays. To test these hypotheses, we deploy unique data from the Dutch Ethnic Minority Election Study 2024 and combine regression analyses on individual experiences with political representation and qualitative analysis of open answers in the survey. \n","This qualitative research delves into the intricate dynamics of Dutch recruitment practices and their impact on Eastern European labour migrants, shedding light on the interplay between these practices and the migrants' human agency. Following the European Union's expansion, the Netherlands has become an attractive destination for Eastern European labour migrants who often seek temporary employment in \"low-skilled\" positions through recruitment agencies. Previous studies consistently reveal the widespread precarity experienced by these migrants in various aspects of their lives and working conditions. The recruitment agencies they are associated with are often seen as exploitative, perpetuating a sense of victimhood among these labour migrants and denying them any human agency. Drawing on de Haas' agentic migration aspiration-capability framework, this study emphasizes the inherent ambiguity of recruitment practices throughout the entire migration process of Eastern Europeans. It explores how recruitment agencies facilitate the migration of these individuals by removing obstacles and providing essential resources, such as a package deal that includes work and housing, along with a crucial market position between workers and employers. Consequently, these agencies appear to monopolize Eastern European workers' access to the Dutch labour market. While this bundled package presents an opportunity for transformative changes in their lives, paradoxically, it also imposes limitations on the migrants' experiences throughout their migration process, creating a dependency on these services. This complex relationship between recruitment agencies and migrants showcases the dual nature of Eastern European migration experiences within the Dutch recruitment context.","Tijdens de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van november 2023 bleek migratie het grootste verkiezingsthema, waarbij houdingen ten aanzien van immigranten sterk uiteenliepen onder Nederlandse burgers. Verschillende studies tonen aan dat het gevoerde politiek-juridische en sociaaleconomische integratiebeleid invloed kan hebben op hoe burgers de komst van immigranten ervaren. Tot op heden is echter minder bekend over de invloed van multicultureel beleid, en met name inburgeringsbeleid, op anti-immigranten houdingen. Dit terwijl de belangrijkste breuklijn in de Nederlandse samenleving van culturele aard is en anti-immigranten houdingen met name worden gevoed door zorgen over onverenigbare culturele verschillen met nieuwkomers. In dit artikel wordt onderzocht of veranderingen in het Nederlandse multiculturele beleid en inburgeringsbeleid tussen 2000 en 2020 invloed hebben gehad op veranderingen in anti-immigranten houdingen van Nederlandse burgers. Daarbij lijken twee mechanismes plausibel: de overheid kan met cultureel integratiebeleid normen omtrent etnische minderheden en culturele diversiteit overdragen op burgers (neo-institutional theory), of gevoelens van culturele dreiging oproepen (group conflict theory), die zij vervolgens meewegen in hun houdingen tegenover immigranten. Daarbij wordt beargumenteerd dat mogelijk beide mechanismes van toepassing zijn, weliswaar in mindere of meerdere mate voor groepen op basis van politiek vertrouwen en opleidingsniveau. De relatie tussen cultureel integratiebeleid en anti-immigranten houdingen, en de modererende werking van deze individuele predisposities, wordt getoetst middels multilevel modelling. Dit kwantitatieve longitudinale onderzoek maakt daarbij gebruik van zowel de Multiculturalism Policy Index en Nederlandse data uit de European Social Survey (rondes 1-10), als van een zelfontwikkelde index die inzicht geeft in veranderingen in het Nederlandse inburgeringsbeleid tussen 2000 en 2020.","Against the backdrop of the political efforts to counter the systemic rural decline, European rural areas are becoming central sites of migrant settlement. Migrants are increasingly portrayed as ”self-sufficient tools” to revitalise communities and counteract rural shrinkage. While this involves increasing cultural diversity, rural areas’ traditional ethnic homogeneity and limited structural conditions may hinder migrant receptivity.  Connected to that, migrant settlement experiences may be hampered by the widespread anti-immigrant discourses which are especially salient in areas that have historically suffered political abandonment and resource deprivation. By comparing migrant settlement experiences in two distinct rural towns in Germany and Spain, this project explores the reception policies and the local reactions and welcoming capacities to migrant rural incorporation. It highlights how local reception and regeneration policies do not only sideline the role of newcomers as rural place-makers, who contribute to the sustainment (or expansion) of local services and infrastructures. They also result in conditions of “predatory inclusion,” in which migrants’ settlement is shaped regarding their potential “use” for (revitalizing) the local economy in exploitative terms and along racialised lines. In this context, local communities advance racialization, exclusion and Othering discourses. Facing precarious labour and housing conditions, migrants tend to reside only temporarily in the analysed areas. This study contributes to an expanding body of migration research in rural areas and problematizes the neoliberal push for rural regeneration through migration. It runs the risk of overlooking migrants’ needs and mobility projects, thus reinforcing the structural, racial, and class-based barriers present in rural areas.","This paper proposes a comprehensive study of the labour market integration barriers and facilitators of highly skilled Latin American women in Flanders, particularly in Antwerp. It emphasises the complex effects of gender, familial roles, and migration status on immigrant women's employment prospects in Belgium, drawing on existing scholarly discourse. Underemployment or difficulty matching qualifications with jobs plagues highly skilled migrant women despite policy efforts. Due to their intersectional identities, highly skilled Latin American women in Antwerp's experiences are understudied. This study proposes semi-structured interviews to capture Latin American women's complex labour market experiences in Antwerp. A qualitative approach rooted in decolonial and anti-racist perspectives seeks to identify the barriers and mechanisms affecting their employment trajectories. The study examines how gender, ethnicity, and policy frameworks affect highly skilled Latin American women's labour market experiences to advance scholarship. It examines how ethno-racial disparities and gender dynamics affect employment outcomes through an intersectional lens. The research aims to inform policy changes and initiatives to better support the labour market integration of highly skilled Latin American women in Antwerp and Flanders by bridging recognition and redistribution dimensions.This research informs policymakers and stakeholders to enable more targeted interventions to address the unique needs and challenges of highly educated Latin American women in Flanders' labour market. The study aims to improve employment opportunities for immigrant women and enrich Belgian society.","Skills in math and language are highly predictive for later outcomes in education and on the labor market. Early stimulation of these skills can have lasting effects. During the preschool period, parents play a crucial role in fostering their children's skill development as caregivers. These early investments come in various forms such as parents’ own math and language skills as indicators of the family’s human capital, parents’ education as indicator of the family’s cultural capital and other obtained skills in education, and household income as indicator of financial resources. As children enter school, their learning environment widens. The relative contribution of the parental resources might be different from the preschool years. Due to the lack of high-quality data on early school performance and subsequent learning growth, and comparable data on parental resources, empirical testing has been limited. Our study focuses on children's school performance in math and language at the start of primary education, as well as their learning growth during primary education, and examines how the three parental resources - parental math and language skills, education, and household income - influence these outcomes. We developed a dataset, combining longitudinal test information of Dutch children in primary education to school survey data and register information of their parents. Using latent growth models, our preliminary results show that early performance in language and math is mostly associated with parents’ skills, while parental education has a bigger influence on the subsequent learning growth in primary education. Household income has the least impact.","Higher education is an industry known for its high prevalence of sexual harassment, even though few victims formally disclose their experience. Reasons for this underreporting include the inability to conceptualise one’s own experience as sexual harassment and fear that it will not be taken seriously by the institution. Following Fricker (2007), we believe both cases could be better understood by viewing it through the lens of hermeneutical injustice, which arises when someone is unable to make their own experience intelligible to themselves or others due to hermeneutical marginalisation and structural inequality. Hence, the main research questions of the current study are: (1) How does hermeneutical injustice play a role in university members’ decision to not report sexual harassment to institutional services?; (2) (How) does hermeneutical injustice occur after reporting sexual harassment to institutional services? \n To answer these research questions, the Belgian sample of the Uni4Equity questionnaire dataset on sexual harassment in higher education will be analysed (N = 1403 for staff and N = 1786 for students) and complemented by in-depth interviews with stakeholders who have been directly involved in sexual harassment cases at Antwerp University. Through the combined data, we wish to provide recommendations to higher education institutions on how to identify hermeneutical injustice during sexual harassment procedures, and to enable universities to limit the negative short- and long-term health and career consequences for victims.","Education serves as both an enhancer of opportunities and a mechanism for the intergenerational reproduction of advantage. To understand which of these two faces of education takes the lead, sociologists studied skill acquisition during periods when children attend school, compared to periods when they do not, such as during the summer break. Such a seasonal comparison approach allows for the examination of exposure to schooling as a channel to raise academic achievement and potentially reduce inequalities by socioeconomic background. Recent doubts about the replicability of seasonal learning gap findings prompt a reevaluation of exposure effects. Therefore, we employ an elaborate differential exposure model to provide more precise and nuanced insights into the efficacy of education in advancing academic achievement and reducing socioeconomic inequalities. Leveraging data from the Netherlands Cohort Study on Education, including national achievement tests in reading and mathematics from Grades 1-5, our study investigates exposure effects by examining the length of intervals between midterm and end-of-term tests. Given that we have rich data over multiple school years, with two test moments per pupil per grade, we can use the different sources of variations to allow for stronger tests of causality of exposure.","The taxation of wealth is a controversial topic in Belgium, particularly in the lead up to the 2024 elections. Taxes on labour in Belgium are relatively high compared to other OECD countries, while taxes on wealth are limited. In light of the growing gap between the few ‘haves’ and the many ‘have-nots’, international institutions such as the IMF, OECD, and the European Commission have recommended increasing taxes on wealth and reducing taxes on labour. Public support for taxes is an important issue, as there is substantial evidence that it strongly influences policy making. However, most empirical research has focused on attitudes toward income rather than wealth redistribution. As income and wealth are intuitively often considered two sides of the same coin, it is important to compare attitudes toward wealth and income taxes. This paper analyses public attitudes toward both income and wealth taxes in Belgium, as well as the determinants of these tax attitudes. It examines both structural variables, such as household income and subjective social class, and cultural variables, such as welfare state attitudes and individualism. The structural variables are based on the theories of rational choice and self-interest, while the cultural variables are based on theories of ideology, values, and beliefs. Structural equation modeling will be applied on data from the Belgian National Election Study 2014 (n = 1901).\n \n Keywords: income taxation, wealth taxation, public attitudes, structural equation modeling","Met de inwerkingtreding van de Wet Kansspelen op Afstand werd het vanaf 1 oktober 2021 mogelijk om in Nederland online kansspelen aan te bieden. Vanaf dat moment mochten aanbieders ook reclame maken voor online kansspelen, met als doel de huidige online kansspeldeelnemers van het illegale naar het gereguleerde legale aanbod te leiden. Voorafgaand aan de legalisering van online kansspelen hebben verschillende Eerste en Tweede Kamerleden hun zorgen geuit met betrekking tot het reclamebeleid. Reclames mogen namelijk niet gericht worden op kwetsbare groepen, waaronder jongeren tot 24 jaar. Het is nog onduidelijk in hoeverre het legaliseren van online kansspelen in Nederland leidt tot een toename van het aantal deelnemers. Om hier inzicht in te verkrijgen is er op basis van een secundaire dataset met 2906 respondenten, aan de hand van logistische regressieanalyses onderzocht hoe groot de kans is dat men gaat deelnemen aan online kansspelen naarmate men blootgesteld is aan kansspelreclames, en of de invloed van reclames groter was voor jongeren dan voor volwassenen. Deze twee analyses zijn ook uitgevoerd per type online kansspel op basis van een grotere steekproef met 4380 respondenten. De uitkomsten van het kwantitatieve onderzoek laten zien dat naarmate men meer blootgesteld is aan reclames voor kansspelen, men sneller geneigd is deel te nemen aan online kansspelen. De impact van reclame op deelname aan online kansspelen was het sterkst bij krasloten en het wedden op paardenraces. De invloed van reclame was echter niet groter voor jongeren ten opzichte van ouderen. Wel blijkt dat jongeren over het algemeen sneller geneigd zijn om deel te nemen aan online kansspelen. Op basis van dit onderzoek concluderen we dat de legalisering van online kansspelen in Nederland zal leiden tot een toename van het aantal online kansspeldeelnemers.","Despite an abundance of studies on how citizens consider welfare deservingness, little is known about the meanings they attribute to these considerations. This is crucial, as these considerations may mean something wholly different for different groups. For example, some may perceive welfare deservingness primarily through the lens of economic considerations, while others may do so primarily through a cultural lens. Inspired by a recent stream of small-n qualitative studies that have explored deservingness considerations among citizens, this paper presents an innovative quantitative analysis of the different meanings citizens attribute to their evaluations of welfare deservingness. I do so by applying the method Correlational Class Analysis to an original survey fielded among a representative sample in the Netherlands (n = 2,131). As such, five meanings are uncovered where people have a unique understanding about welfare deservingness. The people who adhere to these different deservingness meanings differ substantively in terms of social bases, i.e., they differ when it comes to political preference, education, income, religious denomination, and media preference. These findings demonstrate that different groups have fundamentally different things in mind when they think about the welfare deservingness of others. I discuss the implications of these findings for the fields of social policy analysis and, more broadly, sociology and political science.","As part of the Growing Up Together in Society (GUTS) consortium, this research aims to contribute to our understanding of how trust develops in adolescents, with special attention to the role of SES and ethnicity therein. Trust is defined as the willingness to be vulnerable to actions of others while expecting a future reciprocation that is not guaranteed. During adolescence, sociocognitive processes underlying trust such as social learning processes and perspective-taking develop. To determine adolescents’ trust behaviour to different targets, we will employ the modified economic Trust Game to determine adolescents’ trust behaviour towards (i) close (i.e. a parent or a caregiver), and two types of distant targets (i.e. (ii) parent/caregivers of an unknown peer; (iii) individual from contested institutions because of class and ethnic profiling, such as the police and child protection services). Approximately 300 adolescents aged 10 to 20 will be assessed both behaviourally and by functional MRI data acquisition. First, we expect adolescents’ level of trust in the close target to be higher than their trust in the distant targets. Second, because the institutional targets are associated with class and ethnic profiling, we hypothesize that target differentiation will be more pronounced among low-SES and non-white adolescents. Last, we anticipate neural activity in social brain regions, including the precuneus and temporal parietal junction, to reflect this target differentiation.","We hypothesize that (fear of) violent victimization reduces levels of trust in commercial transactions. Social trust is the probability with which one expects others to perform in a particular way. It is expected to increase the propensity to collaborate or exchange, first and foremost, because it reduces the subjectively assessed risk and, thus, the cost of the interaction. It substitutes moreover transaction costs of control monitoring with a less costly alternative. This transactional trust is even more the oil lubricating trade in environments with weak formal institutions. At the same time, these fragile states often suffer from more violence.\n \n We hypothesize that both the fear of crime and the direct or peer-initiated experience of violent crime have a chilling effect on economic cooperation. The mechanism is provided by decreased social trust in transactions.\n \n The empirical estimation relies on survey data of the AFROBAROMETER (round 7), collected in 34 African countries among 46,000 respondents. They gauge the trustworthiness a buyer assesses in a seller of maize or rice. Different matching designs allow us to estimate the real effect of fear of crime and victimization on trust levels in sellers in a commercial market. The impact is assessed with an individual-level and a neighborhood-level estimate of fear of crime and victimization. Both indeed seem to affect trust in commercial transactions significantly.","Social media has become a crucial tool for politicians seeking to connect with, particularly younger, voters. The landscape of online political communication is increasingly dominated by visuals and images. Despite this shift towards visual content, the significant role images and videos play in shaping online political discourse remains underexplored. This presentation delves into the visual narratives crafted by European far-right leaders in the content they share on TikTok and Instagram. Through a qualitative analysis, the visual elements, rhetoric, and symbolism embedded in the videos disseminated by these leaders are examined, providing insights into how these leaders exploit visual platforms to communicate ideologies, construct personas, and enhance community engagement with their followers. The study's findings are linked to the distinctive features of these two platforms, contributing to a better understanding of how far-right party leaders (strategically) present themselves online to mobilize support.","Wetenschappelijk onderzoek laat een trendbreuk zien waarbij jongere generaties er conservatievere en autoritairdere waarden op nahouden dan hun voorgangers (Muis et al., 2019; Muis & Reeskens, 2022). In het publieke debat lijken deze bevindingen echter een nieuwe draai te hebben gekregen. Zo zouden alleen jongens conservatiever worden, terwijl meisjes zich juist steeds progressiever ontwikkelen (e.g., Burn-Murdoch, 2024; The Economist, 2024). Voor deze groeiende ‘ideologische genderkloof’ wordt echter weinig robuust bewijs geleverd: waarden worden gelijkgesteld aan attitudes en stemgedrag, en longitudinale en cross-sectionele perspectieven wisselen elkaar af. In het huidige onderzoek gaan wij na of er onder jongeren inderdaad een genderkloof bestaat die groter is dan onder voorgaande generaties. We richten ons hierbij specifiek op waarden, omdat deze in vergelijking met attitudes en gedrag fundamenteler van aard zijn (Halman & Sieben, 2020), en dus de kern zouden kunnen vormen van (toekomstige) maatschappelijke spanningen. Daarnaast weten we vanuit de gevestigde literatuur dat mannen en vrouwen er inderdaad andere waarden op nahouden, maar er bestaan diverse theorieën over of, hoe, en wanneer deze verschillen groter worden (e.g., Prince-Gibson & Schwartz, 1998; Rokeach, 1974; Norris & Inglehart, 2008). Door gebruik te maken Nederlandse data van de European Values Study (1981-2017) kunnen we de longitudinale trends goed in kaart brengen en focussen we ons op een land waarin genderverschillen aan sterke veranderingen onderhevig lijken (Inglehart & Norris, 2000).","With the debate about multiculturalism being increasingly characterized by mutual radicalization, studies show that a substantial part of the majority population in Western European countries shares a concern about the effect of Islam on democratic values. To counter the bloating effect of these radical narratives, it becomes crucial to get an accurate picture of the actual level of support for liberal democratic principles among Muslim majorities. Moreover, this support should be compared to the majority population, as one can otherwise not make a suitable comparison. \n \n Yet, studies measuring public support of democratic principles, especially those researching minorities, tend to use limited measures. The assumption in these measures is that liberal democracy is a one-dimensional concept that citizens will either accept or reject in a consistent way. However, because of the inherently conflictual nature between different elements of liberal democracy, most importantly between majority rule and constitutional constraints, we argue that these approaches are unfit for capturing how individuals understand democracy. Rather than approaching liberal democratic support as a unidimensional concept, this paper will use a person-centered approach to provide a more nuanced picture of how people combine support for different democratic principles into a consistent belief system.\n \n Using the Belgian National Election Studies of 2019 for the majority population and the Belgian Minority Election Studies of 2019 for the minority population, this study will make use of Multiple-Group Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to distinguish different democratic profiles within both the majority and Muslim minority populations in Belgium. \n","Sustainability scientists need and want sociological theory and insights to help provide theoretical grounding for societal change processes towards a more sustainable future. As a sociological research group in a sustainability department, we have been getting a lot of positive responses from colleagues in the department, at sustainability conferences, and among stakeholders in the field.\nHowever, colleagues in the field of sustainability seem to have trouble finding sociology until we present it to them.

Door etnografie te combineren met vrijwilligerswerk in een speeltuin, een buurtrestaurant en een buurttuin, ga ik in op hoe betrokkenheid bij deze plekken bepaalde slepende spanningen voelbaar maakt: de geracialiseerde, geclassificeerde en gegenderde kwaliteiten van het maken van relaties, vertrouwen en wantrouwen in wetenschap en overheid en conflicten zonder resolutie. Door middel van deze vignetten zal ik Sandra Harding’s vraag \"Whose science? Whose Knowledge?\" herarticuleren: wie heeft er baat bij wetenschappelijke kennis en wiens stem is er betrokken bij de totstandkoming ervan?","In deze bijdrage reflecteren we op het veldwerk van ons lopende onderzoek naar openbare bibliotheken als sociale infrastructuren (‘Infrastructuring Libraries in Transformation’ - ILIT). Een van onze drie onderzoeksthema’s is ‘community librarianship’, bestaande uit participerende observatie in twee bibliotheken en een zine-making workshop met bibliotheekmedewerkers. Als participerende observant liepen we mee met bibliotheekmedewerkers om zo hun dagelijkse werkzaamheden in kaart te brengen en tot op enige hoogte te beleven. Tijdens de zine-making workshop gingen we met medewerkers in gesprek om zowel het gemeenschapsgevoel in en door openbare bibliotheken te bestuderen én te ontwikkelen. Zine-making is zowel een product als een proces dat het mogelijk maakt om verder te gaan dan verbale communicatie en om gelijkheid, sociale rechtvaardigheid en sociale verandering te bevorderen. Binnen etnografisch en participatie onderzoek wordt de onderzoeker verwacht reflexief te zijn. Ook daagt co-productief zine-making de traditionele machtsdynamiek van kennisproductie in de academische wereld uit, waarbij deelnemers de data ontwikkelen en de onderzoeker als facilitator aanwezig is. In onze bijdrage reflecteren we op  hoe we onderzoek doen en stellen we vragen als “hoe gaan we om met feedback van deelnemers?” en “hoe nemen we afscheid wanneer we ‘het veld’ verlaten?”","Veel onderzoek naar sociale infrastructuur behandelt plekken, organisaties, en evenementen die al als sociale infrastructuur functioneren. Hierdoor blijft het moeilijk om te bestuderen hoe sociale infrastructuur gecreëerd kan worden. Bij het Michi Noeki project in Groningen zijn we sinds een vroeg stadium betrokken waardoor we de intenties, processen, en uitkomsten van de implementatie van het project kunnen onderzoeken. Het doel van de Michi Noeki’s is een netwerk van ‘halteplaatsen’ waar men even kan zitten, naar de wc kan, goedkope koffie aanwezig is, en waar de telefoon of scootmobiel opgeladen kan worden. Uiteindelijk moet dit bijdragen aan het vergroten van de mobiliteit van ouderen, het terugdringen van eenzaamheid, en het bevorderen van participatie. In deze bijdrage reflecteer ik op de voor- en nadelen van deze vroege betrokkenheid en de gevolgen voor onderzoeksplanning, relaties tussen actoren, en werving en vertrouwen van uiteindelijke gebruikers en vrijwilligers.","The debate around sex work policy is often characterised by an apparent dichotomy when it comes to the legislative approach to be taken: some form of prohibition or decriminalisation. These oppositional viewpoints have led to what some call the 'prostitution wars'. Given these polarised viewpoints, a thorough investigation of the merits and faults of each policy approach is warranted. We conduct a systematic review using the PRISMA framework. This review allows us to check whether the effects of different policies, regulations, and enforcement types on diverse outcomes have been well documented. Outcomes range from sex workers' health and safety to possible externalities that spill over to the larger community.\n Overall, the most important conclusion of the review is that the quantity of research published is profuse. At the same time, the review indicates that rigid, well-informed and well-designed studies are called for. The hot debate has not given rise to many reliable studies. Notwithstanding the abundance of publications, well-designed empirical research is in short supply. The gap may be due to data scarcity and a skills mismatch between needs and researchers' profiles. \n Findings indicate that criminalisation, also in the case of the so-called Nordic model criminalising clients only,  sex worker displacement is apparent. This displacement mostly seems to increase occupational risks for them. Most studies indicate that the health outcomes are pretty adverse for sex workers. Potentially, the harm also spills over to wider society, for instance, through STIs. Decriminalisation increases supply but concurrently reduces relative risk-taking and adverse outcomes.","Female genital cutting (FGC) refers to various practices involving the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons. In Kenya, where the current study is situated, the practice is increasingly being medicalized, meaning that FGC is more and more performed by medical health professionals rather than traditional practitioners. However, performing FGC is prohibited by law in Kenya, regardless of who conducts it. Research informing FGC abandonment strategies often focuses on coordinating change in norms and behavior among people interacting with one another, starting by identifying key actors in the decision-making process concerning FGC. However, how this information unfolds within the newly emerging evolution toward the medicalization of the practice has not yet been identified. The current research entangles how the trend towards medicalization influences the decision-making process concerning a girl’s cut, by looking at how the decision is made, who influences it, and how this differs between people born in different birth cohorts. We conducted 60 in-depth interviews with mothers with at least one living daughter within the Maasai ethnic group, located in Narok County, and among the Abagusii ethnic group in Kisii County. Preliminary results show several important findings contributing to a better understanding of FGC medicalization and its evolutions. We found crucial insights into the agency for Maasai young women concerning medical decision-making, the normative framework surrounding medicalization among Abagusii mothers, and how its evolutions, underlying reasons for medicalization, and key actors in the decision-making differ between these ethnic groups.","This study explores the trajectories of women presenting for abortion in Flanders, Belgium. It has two primary objectives. First, it maps the various stages of the abortion trajectory for women presenting for abortion. Second, barriers that cause delays within these stages are identified. Data were used from the ATTAS project, which collected data among all women seeking abortion care at one of the Flemish abortion centers; specifically, the LUNA centers. Preliminary results show that a considerable number of women experience difficulties suspecting an unplanned pregnancy. This can be due to various reasons such as not immediately linking the symptoms to a possible pregnancy, mistakenly believing it is hard or impossible to get pregnant in their particular situation. Additionally, over one-third of women who completed the questionnaire up to now first had a consultation with a GP before they contacted the abortion center, which lengthens and in some cases complicates the trajectory. We also found that around 40% of the respondents indicated feeling ashamed or disappointed in themselves when deciding about the pregnancy. However, 94% indicated that their decision was set at the time they completed the questionnaire. Around 46% experienced fear of the procedure and associated pain. Furthermore, qualitative data are currently being collected to gain an in-depth understanding of abortion trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first study within the Flemish context to investigate abortion timing, access, and trajectories. Furthermore, this study is highly topical given the ongoing public and political debates on Belgian abortion legislation.","In this paper, we analyze the relationship between development and outgoing international student mobility (ISM) for the years 2003–2018 using data from UNESCO. Starting from migration transition theory, we expect that development and outgoing migration follows an inverted U-shape due to changes in capabilities and aspirations of populations. As predicted, we find that outgoing ISM also follows this pattern. Probing deeper into this finding, we investigated whether students from countries of different levels of development favor different destination countries, focusing on destination countries’ academic ranking, GDP per capita, and linguistic and colonial ties. We find that these destination country characteristics indeed have different effects for students from origin countries with different stages of development, and that these effects cannot simply be reduced to a dichotomy between developed/developing countries. Together, the findings highlight the nonlinearity of ISM processes. In turn this opens up new avenues of research regarding the diversity of international student populations.","For a long time, internationalisation strategies of higher education institutions across the world focused on international student mobility. However, international student mobility is a socially selective process, whereby students from lower socio-economic backgrounds are less likely to participate. Consequently, in recent years ‘internationalisation for all’, ‘inclusive internationalisation’ and ‘internationalisation at home’ have become prominent terms in internationalisation strategies, aiming to provide internationalisation activities to all students, including those who remain at home. However, recent scholarship indicated students from lower socio-economic backgrounds are less likely to participate in any internationalisation activity compared to students from higher socio-economic background. In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms behind such selectivity patterns, based on an analysis of 28 in-depth interviews conducted with students from different social backgrounds as well as 3 focus groups with educational program directors at a Dutch higher education institution.","The analyses of the trends and flows in International Student Mobility (ISM) overlooks different trajectories, geographies, and rationales of the phenomenon. The tendency to conceptualize ISM as an involvement of the global elite shades the movements of the students with mobility capital shortage. Several studies documented that a lack of academic, economic, social, and mobility capital restrains the direct movement of International Students (IS) to a target country. This evokes a stepwise migration by stationing in an intermediary country to complete part of the higher education study and move forward to targeted destinations later, preferably after completing their study in the station country. There is very limited research on the role of academic, social, and economic experiences of the IS in their stepwise migration intentions. Drawing and theorizing on the stepwise migration theory this study investigates the factors playing role in the onward mobility intentions of IS in Turkey. First, a quantitative study for predicting the role of academic, social, and economic variables in onward mobility intentions was conducted with 1752 international students in Turkey originating from the Middle East, Africa, Central Asia, and South East Asia. Next, interviews with 27 students were conducted to further explain the quantitative results. Preliminary descriptive analyses indicated that almost half of the students (49.5%) wanted to go to a Western country for different reasons (e.g., graduate study, temporary settlement, etc.), which is also supported by qualitative data. Besides, the results showed that academic quality, field of study, social networking with other international students, prospect of finding a job in the station country (Turkey), and affordability of the tuition in the station country (Turkey) predict the students’ onward mobility intentions. These results suggest that the lived experiences of international students reestablish the notion of semi-peripheral countries as stepping stones for international students in their stepwise migration trajectories.","International student mobility (ISM) is often assumed to enhance the labour market prospects of graduates. Studying abroad may signal extracurricular skills and certain personality traits and social class, as ISM is more common among students of higher social origin. Accordingly, one could hypothesize that ISM provides a competitive edge in the labour market. However, studies looking labour market adaptation of graduates with and without ISM experience find limited support for this. This paper investigates the value of ISM from an employer perspective. We address how employers assess higher education from abroad when hiring employees. Data are drawn from the Norwegian Employer survey, conducted by NIFU in 2022. The response rate of this survey is 43, information from more than 10 000 employers are included.  The survey contains an experimental design; employers were presented with hypothetical candidates with different characteristics and asked to indicate how likely they are to hire these. One of the characteristics that varied between the candidates was experience with ISM.  Results show that employers consider graduates who have one year of ISM experience to be just as likely to hire as graduates without ISM experience. The study also looked at employers' assessments of applicants with a full degree abroad versus applicants with an all-Norwegian degree. Employers were less inclined to employ applicants with a diploma from abroad than applicants graduated in Norway. This applies to both graduates with has a Norwegian-sounding name and for graduates a foreign-sounding name, but the effect was stronger for the latter group.","In the first years of a child’s life, family members play a crucial role as childcare providers. This form of social support helps parents attend to their own needs and responsibilities, including staying connected with friends and participating in the labour market, while ensuring that the child is supervised. However, family childcare is not always available: family conflicts, overburdened grandparents, and geographical distance can leave parents without family help. Previous childcare policy research has largely disregarded how such characteristics of the family network condition the availability of family childcare. Instead, family childcare has been conceptualised in terms of dyadic relationships between family members or family relationships confined within household walls. This narrow understanding of families disregards how childcare arrangements are embedded in family networks comprising a large number of interdependent family members. To address this issue, we argue that the structure and composition of family networks condition whether and how family childcare is available. Using population-scale family network data sourced from administrative registers, we map the availability of family childcare for parents with childcare-age children in the Netherlands. We compare our register-based measures with typical survey-based measures of family childcare for those parents who participate in the LISS survey. We also study how the availability of family childcare varies across parental educational attainment, a central concern in the childcare policy literature. The use of network theory and methods helps us improve upon previous measures of family childcare and provide a large-scale picture of inequality in early childhood in the Netherlands.","This article analyses the social networks of rural-urban migrant entrepreneurs in Uganda. While social contacts are often an important asset to access resources for migrants, they are often expected to financially support the members of their social networks. These claims for support are here labelled ‘negative social capital’, following Portes’ seminal work. This paper focuses on the kinds of networks that are more likely to produce negative social capital, operationalised here as requests for financial resources, and links this to the discourse on bridging and bonding social capital. By means of a regression analysis, this article provides evidence of dense networks with a higher share of migrants (bonding social capital) being associated with negative social capital. In addition, both a higher share of contacts met before migration, which is related to bonding social capital, and a higher share of contacts living in the city, which is related to bridging social capital, are negatively associated with requests for resources. These findings suggest that migrants can instrumentally keep some contacts from before migration and acquire new key contacts in the urban area.","Advertisers have increasingly turned towards social media influencers to build brand identities and promote products online, with recent findings indicating a positive correlation between social media use and young adults’ levels of materialism. Focusing on the widely popular TikTok platform, this research asks: how are materialistic values conveyed in American influencer videos? Despite the myriad consequences of materialism – including increased ecologically wasteful behaviors – and indications that materialistic cues in media content may foster a more materialistic value orientation in individuals, little work has explored how materialism is portrayed in new media content. Employing a qualitative Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA) of 100 videos from the top 10 American TikTok influencers, findings of this study indicate that materialism is portrayed in three primary ways: through Physical Appearance, Interaction with Material Items and Brands, and Material Surroundings. Furthermore, materialistic values were found to be mobilized via four significant sub-themes including body language and facial expressions, friends and community, celebrity status and fame, and performing. The results of this research hold implications for stakeholders and individuals concerned with protecting social media users from repeat exposure to materialistic cues that may cultivate a more materialistic value orientation. The findings also support prior evidence that materialism shows up in distinctly gendered ways, and ultimately substantiates current work on influencer marketing and materialism.","It should come as no surprise that conversational motivations have a profound impact on how the conversations play out. We use conversations to gather information, negotiate norms, seek social aims, and more. Yet, in the context of interpersonal discussion on risk, i.e., risk talk, attention to the role of conversational motivation has hitherto been scattered. While research often finds risk talk to be a significant predictor of risk perception, the direction of this correlation is far from straightforward and often differs between studies. A structured approach to the motivations of risk talk may help us disentangle the relationship between risk talk and risk perception as well as deliver insights into the ways, in which risk is explored, conceptualized, and negotiated at the interpersonal level. Based on a synthesis of existing research within and outside of risk talk research, I highlight the following four main drivers: risk talk as 1) a learning/sensemaking avenue; 2) norm negotiation and identity affirmation; 3) emotional support; and 4) an instrument for social objectives. The novelty of this framework is two-fold. First, the framework facilitates the theoretical distinction and empirical disentanglement of the effects of different motivations for and within risk talk. This also opens the conversation on how individuals actively use risk talk for a variety of purposes rather than risk talk simply being something that occurs to them. Second, the framework holds straightforward applicability to both quantitative and qualitative approaches to risk talk, which will help bridge the division currently existing in the field. \n \n COMMENT: Mijn taalvoorkeur is Engels, maar indien nodig kan het ook in het Nederlands.","In tijden van toenemende diversiteit en ongelijkheid vormt het behouden van sociale cohesie een cruciale maatschappelijke uitdaging. Positief intergroepscontact speelt een sleutelrol in het samenbrengen van verschillende sociaaleconomische en etnische groepen. Dit contact kan plaatsvinden in verschillende lokale gemeenschappen, waaronder woonbuurten en maatschappelijke organisaties zoals sportclubs. Maar eerder onderzoek laat zien dat deze gemeenschappen vaak gesegregeerd zijn, waardoor de mogelijkheden tot positief intergroepscontact beperkt worden. De precieze oorzaken en gevolgen van segregatie in buurt- en verenigingsleven blijven onduidelijk. Daarom onderzoeken wij in hoeverre segregatie wordt veroorzaakt door ‘homophily’ (de voorkeur voor gemeenschappen met meer mensen die op ons lijken), ten opzichte van homogene ontmoetingskansen. We maken gebruik van surveymodules, uitgevoerd binnen de LISS en TRIAL surveypanels. Ze bevatten rijke gegevens over de sociale samenstelling van de woonbuurten en organisaties van respondenten, en over intergroepscontact binnen deze gemeenschappen. Daarnaast bevatten ze keuze-experimenten, waarin respondenten kiezen tussen buurten en organisaties die verschillen in, onder andere, hun sociaaleconomische en etnische samenstellingen. Hiermee brengen we in kaart wat de voorkeuren zijn van mensen met betrekking tot de sociale samenstelling van lokale gemeenschappen, hoe dit afhangt van het type gemeenschap, en hoe dit verschilt tussen sociale groepen. Voorlopige bevindingen suggereren dat hoger opgeleide personen buurten en organisaties vermijden die hen in contact zouden brengen met lager opgeleiden personen. Etnische segregatie kan daarentegen niet worden verklaard door voorkeuren voor etnische gelijkenis. Kortom, ons onderzoek biedt inzicht in de ontstaanswijze en het voortbestaan van segregatie in buurt- en verenigingsleven, en daarmee hoe lokale gemeenschappen intergroepscontact kunnen belemmeren.","Precarious jobs can be experienced as precarity of work (i.e., related to the continuity of work), at work (i.e., unsafe working conditions), or from work (i.e., holding a job that does not meet one’s basic needs). Within all three, precarity may translate into engagement with work and individuals’ wider lives. Resilience is one understanding of why and how precarity experienced within one’s job may unfold differently for various people. Whether or not individuals resiliently cope in relation to their precarious work may be tied to personal, social, and historical dynamics. Our study aims to better understanding of whether (or not) precarity on the job translates to precarity in life for individual workers, their families, and the social context in which citizens participate.\n \tWhile working alongside participants we asked (1) the origin of and experience at work, (2) what work entailed and future considerations, and (3) situated precarity in life. We will thematically code all references of precarity of work, at work, and from work, and related precarity in their (social) lives. Last, we synthesize collective findings to get an understanding of precarity as a social phenomenon.\n           Preliminary understanding, based on informal interactions, indicate that precarity on the job not always translates to precarity in life, especially not for older citizens. Resilience is often viewed as an individual character or as patterns within labor market(s). Our preliminary finding hint towards a more social dynamic of resilience; when experienced precarity on the job does not automatically translates into the wider lives of individual citizens, this is often due to specific social dynamics within the lives of citizens (e.g., the possibility to help others, having (social) autonomy). \n            Our findings emphasize the heterogeneity of precarity, which may be best explained as a social phenomenon instead of an individual one. \n \n","Taste in music, literature, and the arts has been a rich site for studying the relationship between culture and stratification for decades. This work consistently finds that socioeconomic status shapes the volume of culture consumed, yet questions about the breadth of musical tastes remain. The effects of racial and ethnic inequality also remain submerged in most of the existing research; serving as controls but little more. To address these issues, we use regression analysis to differentiate between the volume of cultural items and the breadth of taste patterns. Using two years of the Survey of Public Participation in the Arts (2008, 2012) (n=2,773), the findings suggest that volume and breadth are shaped by different kinds of social hierarchy. The sheer volume of cultural items selected is predicted by parental education levels (inherited cultural capital), but the breadth of choices is more clearly shaped by race/ethnicity differences. The taste patterns of Whites tend to have less breadth than those of Blacks, Hispanics, or Asians in the US. These findings confirm existing qualitative work which suggests that minorities have to navigate between dominant and non-dominant cultural worlds, in a way that their White counterparts do not. We argue that a strict focus on socioeconomic status in taste research has been short-sighted; and that considering how patterns have been shaped by race/ethnicity is long overdue.","Live music is finding increasing space in the digital sphere, with musicians utilizing digital platforms to perform for virtual audiences while acquiring new revenue streams. Twitch - a leading livestreaming platform known originally for gaming content - is a prime example of this, providing musicians infrastructure for social relations and voluntary monetary contributions all from the comfort of their homes. The social nature of Twitch allows artists to interact with their audience yielding various forms of exchange, with direct and indirect requests for monetary support intertwined with intimate interaction moments. Through a video analysis of twenty livestreamed performances from the twenty top rated Twitch artists (57 hours 59 mins), this paper maps these interactions asking how artists navigate the public/private space to exert gift giving. We frame our analysis based on Zelizer's economic-sociological perspectives and further discuss Twitch interactions as supporting a particular \"circuit of commerce\" where intimacy and money intertwine, giving rise to an online busking practice. Online busking through Twitch becomes possible due to two main factors: a) the household becoming the locus of production, distribution, and exchange, and b) the standardized interaction rituals intermediated by an online social infrastructure that codifies meaning into symbols, money, words and audiovisuals. While interacting in these settings, audiences and artists bridge the gaps between solidarity and monetary transactions by repeating patterns, thus making online twitching a special form of busking, one highly standardized, where artists ritualize the moment to personalize a rather impersonal space, forming an online community.","Combining insights from studies on hegemonic masculinity and feminist geography this research examines how young, white, cisgender, and straight men negotiate masculinity in inclusive nightlife spaces in Rotterdam. Inclusive nightlife spaces blur the boundaries between marked and unmarked identities, and this historically privileged and unmarked group seems to respond to inclusivity policies in various ways. Therefore, it is needed to address majorities’, not only minorities, experiences of inclusive and safe nightlife spaces to better understand how safety and inclusivity can be stimulated.  The research draws from 14 semi-structured interviews, with participants recruited from inclusive nightlife. The findings suggest that hegemonic masculinity is renegotiated via two strategies: 1. inconspicuous masculinity, and 2. transactional masculinity. Through inconspicuous masculinity the men make their masculinity less visible. Typical hegemonic masculine practices such as chasing girls and excessive drinking become inconspicuous in inclusive spaces. Through transactional masculinity generally subordinate masculine practices, such as caring for others, are traded into new practices by framing it in other masculine meanings, such as protectors of minorities. However, the inclusive nightlife venues seem to be situated in a paradox of inclusivity. Namely, some participants felt repressed and considered themselves part of a ‘marginalised majority’, as they perceived the inclusive venues as exclusive of non-minorities. This study finds that attempts to foster an inclusive nightlife may not be as straightforward as to ‘just’ include everyone. Rather, the findings suggest that blurring boundaries through inclusivity policies may stimulate polarization between marked and unmarked groups more than bonding between the various social groups.","Music affects physiological and social well-being. Medical research shows that individual engagement with preferred music can mitigate anxiety, stress, and pain. Concurrently, sociological research shows that music can foster a sense of community through the physical co-presence of audience and artists, facilitating a shared focus and generating a feeling of “togetherness.” What is missing, is an integrated approach that merges medical and sociological perspectives. Little is known about the physiological effects of music outside the clinical setting. Additionally, existing medical studies predominantly concentrate on classical music, thereby a priori disregarding potential well-being benefits offered by popular music. Also, little is known about the relationship between the physiological responses induced by concerts and their subjective experiential aspects. To address these gaps, we (Erasmus University, Erasmus Medical Center, and the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra) carried out an experiment in which 145 participants attended classical and pop concerts. To assess physiological well-being, we measured participants’ Heart Rate Variability (HRV), which indicates whether they were relaxed or stressed. To gauge social well-being, participants filled out surveys about their enjoyment of the music, and the connection they felt with the performers, other audience members, and to people in general. As a control, half of the participants attended the concerts livestreamed in a nearby hall. At the time of writing, the analysis is being prepared. We look forward to discuss our preliminary findings.","Work in the creative industries, and music in particular, is often seen as rewarding, highlighting the freedom enjoyed by creatives, and foreground the passion they have for their work. Yet, those rewards rarely translate into generous financial rewards (Been et al., 2023). Moreover, the rewards creatives obtain from their activities are also distributed unevenly, structurally disadvantaging different demographic groups (Brook et al., 2020), particularly women. Earlier research, for example, has shown that income from music royalties for men is three times higher than that of women (Berkers et al., 2019), and the ample existing research on self-reported income shows profound differences here as well (Berkers et al., 2019). However, self-reported data is notoriously unreliable and income from royalties is limited whereas live music has become increasingly important in the business models of artists. Hence, this study examines gender differences in artist guarantees for live concerts, drawing on a unique database from a leading Dutch booking agency (n= 20,000). Preliminary results show a clear gender pay gap but also shows a more nuanced picture where we find differences between music genres.","Sociologists have scrutinized the unique features of labour conditions in the cultural industries – and the music industries specifically - the methodological implications for researching in this sector have not been given much attention (McRobbie 2016; Everts 2023). Music professionals are characterised by high cultural capital but relatively low economic capital: while (senior) employees have considerable cultural influence as key gatekeepers, their financial situation often does not always reflect an elite status (Brook et al. 2020). Music sector workers navigate an industry ‘in crisis’ with limited space and resources available (Hesmondhalgh and Baker 2011), while gatekeeping practices reproduce or legitimise social inequalities (Negus 1999). Based on a qualitative research project on a specific subgroup of music professionals (nightclub promoters), this paper explores how qualitative interviews could attune better to the specific conditions of the music industries. First, methodological literature often conceptualises the power in interview setting through the relationship between interviewer and interviewee (Ellersgaard et al. 2022). However, engaging with literature on whiteness (Ahlstedt 2015), the paper argues that researchers share a ‘sameness’ with interviewees that obscures the workings of power during interviews. Second, the informal work culture of the music industries adds to complexities around gaining access to elites: a particular ‘elite informality’. Third, talking about music is like dancing about architecture – or is there a good way to get at music professionals’ poetics? The paper adds to recent methodological debates in qualitative sociology that understand power as fluid and context-dependent rather than static (Lancaster 2017; Ellersgaard et al. 2022).","Music managers play a key role in the music industry, mediating between the artist, the audience and other key stakeholders. Yet, we know relatively little about this profession. How does one become a music manager? What education and skills are needed? What are the main challenges these professionals run into? Based on a survey (n=300) and in-depth interviews, we address the question what it means to be a music manager? Preliminary results show that - highly educated – most managers did not gain the skills they use in music management from degree programs. Most learned by doing. They identify managing the vulnerability, health and or well-being of artists as the most important skill. The main challenges are financial and time management issues.","The 1989 fall of Romanian socialism spurred the transition toward a unique form of neoliberal capitalism. Although much has been written on the transformation of Eastern European economies, little is known about how cultural actors from the music sector have made sense of the abrupt evaporation of a seemingly monolithic cultural system and unshakable way of life. Making use of extensive archival research, this contribution traces the development of Romanian musicians and policymakers in their transition from socialism to capitalism: if under socialism, the state embodies the central power at the top of the political pyramid which relies on the skills of musicians to legitimise itself and reorganise social values, with the transition to capitalism, ‘the state’ is replaced by ‘the market’ at the core of the socio-cultural imaginary. Our analysis offers a nuanced examination of the altered dynamics post-1989, exploring how the ‘rules of the game’ change and how cultural actors navigate for economic (financial gains) and symbolic capital (artistic prestige). Faced with both opportunities and challenges, these cultural actors do not only have to find and make meaning from the shadows of and within the music industry, but ultimately must adapt their cultural toolkits and remodel discourses and practices according to a new logic: the cultural logic of uncertainty that defines post-socialist capitalism.","This study analyses the value of qualifications in the Surinamese education system and develops an SRLED (Surinamese Level of Education) using optimal scaling in a large-scale dataset (SURMOB2012, N=3929). We conceive of the value of a qualification as deriving from two related but not identical processes:\n •\tThe value in the labour market and the marriage market: to what level of jobs, income and spouse does a certain qualification lead?\n •\tThe value of qualifications is revealed by the competition of low and high status parents.\n \n Technically, this constitutes an optimal scaling model in which qualifications operate as the mediator between social origins and social destinations.  The resulting scale values of SRLED are broadly arranged according to the primary, junior secondary, senior secondary and tertiary levels, but the value of vocational and academic tracks varies between these levels: vocational qualifications score better at lower levels and academic tracks at the higher levels. Incomplete qualification generally obtains a value below a completed qualification, but above the next lower lever: incomplete education is valuable and does not – overall – create a scar in the Surinamese context.\n The issue of whether or not to include incomplete qualifications in the measurement of education has special relevance to the ISSP and other projects that have adopted the recently developed International Standard Classification of Education 2011 as its coding frame. ISCED-2011, a three digit coding systems, allows for the proper classification of incomplete qualifications by its third digit.","Against the background of population ageing and policies to stimulate longer working lives, this study examines poverty among older people and retirees in Europe along well-established lines of social stratification: employment status, age, gender, education and (last) occupation. Prior studies have shown that generous state pensions are able to alleviate poverty, that is, in countries that provide higher state pension income, poverty is less prevalent among the older population. However, it is unclear to what extent state pension systems are also able to alleviate social inequality in poverty. Welfare state theories predict that especially social categories that are vulnerable to end up in poverty gain resources from welfare benefits. When thinking of such benefits, people commonly think of unemployment or housing benefits, but old-age benefits are also part of a country’s welfare provisions. Exploiting two decades of European Social Survey data, this study examines this open question by looking at differences in poverty between people with and without a paid job, between people with different ages (even in the sample restricted to older individuals), between men and women, between the lower and higher educated, and between those who occupy or occupied (if fully retired) lower- and higher-status jobs. It also explores whether social inequality in poverty has increased over time. What has been the impact of increases in statutory retirement ages? Have certain social categories been hit disproportionately? Answering these questions will identify social groups that face higher risks of poverty in old age and may provide clear policy implications.","This study employs the intersectionality framework to quantitatively investigate social inequalities in the returns of resources in benefit receipt at the intersection of gender, migration background, and age. Conventionally, studies aiming to explore underlying mechanisms for inequalities in benefit receipt have focused on the association with resource deficits (i.e., economic, social, cultural, and person capital) and benefit receipt. The implicit assumption commonly used in these studies is that the returns of resources are homogenous. However, a well-documented phenomenon is that certain social groups may experience diminished returns on their capitals. Therefore, the research question of this paper reads: To what extend do the effects of economic, social, cultural an person capital on benefit receipt vary at the intersection of gender, migration background and age? Using a unique combination of register and longitudinal survey data, I estimate Longitudinal Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (longitudinal MAIHDA). We find possitive associations between economic and person capital and benefit receipt, with social capital showing significance when uncontrolled for other capitals. Secondly, we find that economic capital may have a buffering effect for disadvantaged groups, but that this effect works two ways and acts as a double-edged sword. In social groups with a stronger positive association between economic capital and benefit receipt, people with fewer economic resources may be disproportionately vulnerable to benefit receipt. The findings underscore the imperative consideration of intersectional complexities in quantitative analyses and advocate for tailored interventions that recognize diverse resource impacts on distinct social groups.","The economic and cultural dimensions of stratification are well known. However, in Turkey, political and religious dynamics intersect in unique ways, alongside economic and cultural aspects. This intersection serves as the primary inspiration and foundation of this research, aimed at exploring the complexity of lifestyle differences and the diverse factors that shape them. The argument posited in this research is grounded in the premise that lifestyle differences are multifaceted, influenced not solely by economic variables or access to resources, but also by the interplay of immaterial aspects such as religion, politics, and morality. The objective of this research is to investigate how sub-groups within the middle class, characterized by their lifestyles, vary in establishing symbolic boundaries shaped by socio-economic, cultural, religious, political, and moral dynamics. To accomplish this objective, the chapter utilizes Lamont’s (1992) conceptual framework of symbolic boundary work, which builds upon Bourdieu’s (1984) foundational ideas. This framework helps to explore how individuals categorize and evaluate various lifestyles, including their own, by creating distinct boundaries for differentiation. Drawing on 36 in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with middle-class individuals who frequent Mado, a local chain of cafes and restaurants in Istanbul, this study identifies four distinct lifestyle groups within each sub-group of the middle class: 1) cultured exclusives, 2) intellectuals, 3) money-runner jump-ups, and 4) religion-loving conservatives. By considering religious, political, and moral dynamics, this study addresses gaps in social stratification research by utilizing empirical data from a non-Euro-American context.","The occupational aspirations of children have been found to depend on children’s social origins. However, it remains unclear what in an occupation is valued more by which children. Previous research has focused on predicting aspirations in terms of aspired socioeconomic status (SES) rather than predicting the actual aspired occupation. By doing so it cannot explain whether aspirations are stratified because 1) children from higher social origins have a stronger preference for occupations with high SES or because 2) they have a stronger preference for certain types of occupations regardless of the occupations’ SES. This study seeks to address this gap by assessing which occupational characteristics increase or lower the probability that a given occupation is aspired. In this regard, occupational stereotypes are argued to play a central role. Stereotypes are a crucial source of information when children form their aspirations. Additionally, varying social origins may affect the way children evaluate those stereotypes contributing to the stratification of aspirations. By leveraging word embeddings to map over 10,000 occupation titles in a cultural space, I measure their stereotypical images. This information alongside SES and Swiss data on occupational aspirations is used to estimate conditional logit models predicting occupational aspirations. These models allow me to assess which occupational characteristics are most influential for occupational aspirations and whether their influence depends on children’s social origin. By delving into occupational stereotypes in addition to SES, this study aims to illuminate the nuanced factors contributing to the stratification of children's occupational aspirations.","In the past decades, family life has changed. People remain single more often, enter relationships later, are less likely to marry and more likely to dissolve a relationship. We know little about what these trends imply for the living arrangements of those aged 30 to 60. This age group is interesting, because it is traditionally viewed as the main period in which people establish a family of their own. I pool data from 10 Rounds of the European Social Survey to examine trends in the living arrangements of middle adults across Europe. Key questions I want to answer are: 1. To what extent is ‘traditional’ family life (i.e. being married with kids) on the retreat across Europe? How large are the differences in this regard? 2. Is this retreat apparent among all social strata? I expect a retreat from “traditional family life” across Europe, but that this retreat is stronger in countries with more individualized values and in countries with poor arrangements to combine work and family life.","Ruud Luijkx took over the role of national coordinator of the International Social Survey Programme from Harry Ganzeboom.

Over the same period, birth rates also declined markedly. These developments are not unique to the Netherlands, but can also be found – to a varying extent – in many other rich societies. This raises the question to what extent housing conditions inhibit young adults from having children, and whether this depends on the macro-level situation on the housing market. To explore this question, the present study uses data from the Generations and Gender Survey (GGS) to examine how young adults’ housing conditions are associated with their fertility intentions. First, I investigate how characteristics of individuals’ homes – including homeownership, the number of rooms, and satisfaction with one’s home – are associated with the intention to have a(nother) child in the next three years. Second, I examine to what extent respondents themselves report living in housing that is suitable for having a(nother) child. In both analyses I will compare results for the Netherlands with those for other countries for which recent data are available, using macro-level housing market indicators – such as the availability of public housing, the house-price-to-income ratio, and the accessibility of mortgages – to explain potential differences in findings between countries. This allows me to explore the hypothesis that a (perceived) lack of high-quality, child-friendly housing constitutes a stronger barrier to having children in countries where housing is less accessible and less affordable.","As large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, continue to evolve, by being trained on vast corpora of human-generated data, a pivotal question emerges: to what extent do LLMs begin to mirror not only the linguistic and cognitive capabilities of humans but also venture into the realm of strategic thinking and social behaviour? To answer this question, we ask three existing LLMs: ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard, to play each against themselves in economic trust games and we compare the results to those obtained using real human players. More specifically, we designed three variants of economic trust games with role play  of LLMs to test if these models can integrate strategic reasoning with social understanding, such as how to play as a selfish or reciprocal player. We also compare repeated versus one-shot trust games, which require different levels of strategic reasoning. We found that LLMs are able to “play” selfishly or reciprocally in a given context. This implies the training process of LLMs extends beyond language acquisition to the learning of norms and values embedded. Nevertheless, LLMs still struggle to make consistent decisions, which integrate both strategic reasoning and social understanding as we observe in real human players.","The public continuously seeks scientific expertise on pressing issues and the scientists are becoming increasingly conscious of the importance of engaging with the public through different media outlets. Yet, time in the spotlight is unequally distributed between women and men in science. The underrepresentation of women in the public sphere can exacerbate stereotypes of science as a domain more suitable for men and deepen the gender gap in scientific representation. Here, we contribute to the understanding of gender differences in media representation in two ways. We first evaluate whether gender inequalities in media representation are exacerbated by cumulative advantage where reputable scientists accrue further recognition, while the unrecognized ones increasingly lag behind. Second, we suggest the presence of so-called social network “second-order” cumulative advantage: the cumulative advantage of the media popularity of scientists’ social ties (i.e., coauthors) flows over to increasingly benefit the focal scholar. We expect that the advantages of having similarly popular ties might differ between men and women, further exacerbating the gender/media representation gap. We obtain the full list of professors at Dutch universities in 2021 and reconstruct their entire careers through metadata of their academic publications, citations, (past) institutional affiliations, and information about 1.35 million co-authors. We further crosswalk the scholarly data to media data using the LexisNexis and Altmetric databases. Our dataset allows us to understand to what extent cumulative advantage drives the success of “superstar” professors, and whether these dynamics exacerbate gender difference in media presence over time.","Segregation and polarisation are two pressing societal problems. Residential segregation, along ethnic, economic or other key social dimensions, exacerbates social inequality and hampers inter-group contact and trust. Political polarisation both breeds and is further fuelled by echo-chambers in social media, which provide fertile grounds for the spreading of falsehoods and further extremization. Division lines in society running across geographic space (i.e. segregation) or opinion space (i.e. polarisation) can lead to group conflict and threaten the functioning of democracy. \nExperimental work – artificial computer experiments and small-scale lab experiments – showed that segregation and polarization are interconnected, but exactly how remains elusive. Large scale empirical work with observational data on their relationship is, however, lacking. We simply do not know how these phenomena are interrelated in the societies we live in and when and where a vicious circle may arise in which segregation and polarization between groups may mutually reinforce each other. Knowledge on the empirical association of the phenomena and evidence of their causal interconnection is pivotal in understanding potential threats to democracy and societal cohesion. This project, therefore, aims to answer the following research question: \n\nHow, when and where is residential segregation related to political polarization in the Netherlands?\n\nTo move the field forward, this project will take a (theoretically informed) computationally intensive data-driven approach. First, we will discuss how to define, identify and visualize different patterns of residential segregation. We will pay special attention to issues of scale – and by extension to spatial measures of segregation –, acknowledging that both patterns of segregation and consequences of segregation may be scale dependent. We will use techniques of spatial analysis and social network analysis and take full advantage of the available fine-grained spatial data of Statistics Netherlands. Second, we will investigate how these segregation patterns are related to polarized voting behavior. Our data source for the latter will be election results at the polling station level for the last two election rounds (2021 and 2023).","Social media play an increasingly important role in society, as related to the diffusion of (dis)information, polarization, civic and political participation, wellbeing, and social cohesion. However, by far most of the research on social media focusses on the “traditional” social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook but largely ignores mobile instant messenger services (MIMSs) such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, even though these  meanwhile rival social media platforms in popularity. A key reason for the scarcity of research is that in contrast to traditional social media platforms, MIMSs are hardly accessible to researchers since they typically lack a public web interface and any centrally collected data are proprietary. As a result, the scarce empirical research on MIMSs relies on specific publicly accessible WhatsApp groups or on surveys among small convenience samples. Consequently, this research provides little insight in the overall network topology of instant messenger networks: we lack knowledge about even the most basic topological features of the societal-scale instant messenger network.\n\nWhile MIMS data are not directly accessible to researchers, the EU General Data Protection Regulation grants users themselves the right to electronic copies of their data. Taking advantage of this fact, we employ the innovative approach of data donation respondents of a high-quality panel in the Netherlands to collect user data while preserving their privacy. Focusing on WhatsApp as the most popular MIMS, this study collects the first measurement of MIMS usage on a nationally probability sample.\n\nWe report first results for a data collected among respondents of the LISS panel in early 2023. We describe core features of the network topology, the group structure, and socio-economic predictors of use patterns. Furthermore, we assess the method in terms of selectivity and validity.","The current research employed a person-centered and domain-specific approach to examine Belgian majority group members’ expectations regarding immigrant acculturation in private and public domains, utilizing a large-scale national probability sample. Applying latent profile analysis we identified three expectation profiles: Those who made a clear distinction between the public and private domain, expecting assimilation to Belgian culture in public but favoring immigrants maintaining their heritage culture in private (“public-private distinction”, 58.7%); those who expected assimilation (“assimilation”, 13.2%), and those who favored integration of Belgian culture and immigrant’s heritage culture (“integration”, 28.1%) regardless of the domain. Subsequent multinomial logistic regression revealed that the profiles differed in perceived symbolic threat, with those in the integration profile feeling the least, and those in the assimilationist profile most threatened. Moreover, we found that those in the integration profile were more likely to have intergroup friends than those in the assimilationist profile, and they supported religious expression in public more. Our findings illustrate the value of employing a simultaneous person-centered and domain specific approach. In the absence of our person-centered approach, we might have captured only an overall preference for adoption in public and maintenance at home, rather than the three identified profiles, which show that this does not hold true for all participants. Conversely, had we only examined the public domain, we might have concluded that over 70% strongly expect assimilation. Taken together, we thus encourage researchers to adopt both a person-centered and domain-specific approach when examining acculturation attitudes and expectations.","The interethnic contact literature has traditionally examined interactions between members of discrete, mutually exclusive ethnic groups. However, many people with a migration background identify with both the ethnicity of their (grand)parents and with the national majority in the host country, combining these identities into a dual identity (e.g., ‘Turkish-Dutch’). We argue that contact with dual identifiers might result in particularly positive intergroup relations, as for many people, dual identifiers are in- and outgroup members at the same time.\n \n Therefore, we examined to what extent people identifying with only one ethnic group hold more positive attitudes towards ethnic outgroups when they have contact with dual identifiers. In Study 1 (N = 659), we used cross-sectional ego-centered network data collected among native Dutch adults, measuring contact with dual identifiers based on the perceived ethnic belonging of friends. In Study 2 (N = 1,486), we used longitudinal whole network data collected in German schools, and measured contact with dual identifiers based on the self-reported dual identification of friends.\n \n Study 1 showed that contact with minority members perceived as dual identifiers strongly related to more positive outgroup attitudes, even more strongly than contact with those perceived as belonging to the ethnic outgroup only. However, Study 2 showed that contact with people self-identifying as dual identifiers was not significantly related to outgroup attitudes, suggesting that contact with dual identifiers can play a particularly influential role in improving intergroup relations, but only when dual identifiers are perceived as such.\n","Harmonious intergroup relations are key to peaceful, democratic societies. Fortunately, a treasure trove of academic work addresses how people come to accept or reject others, such as majorities’ attitudes concerning ethnic minorities. However, most studies focus on minorities as objects of exclusion. Consequently, we currently know markedly little about how minorities themselves view other stigmatized groups. As societies are becoming increasingly diverse, expanding our understanding of inclusion not only of but also by minorities is vital.\n \n The insights we do have seem contradictory. Some argue that minorities lash out against other stigmatized groups to gain power and status. Others conversely argue that marginalized groups are inclusive, to not do onto others as is done onto them. As both perspectives have gained some empirical support, the answer to “are minorities more or less inclusive than dominant majorities?” seems to be “it depends”. The present study addresses the logical follow-up question: on what? More specifically, I theorize and empirically test under what conditions ethno-religious minorities support homosexuality, women’s rights, and migration.\n \n Refining and synthesizing insights from diverse disciplines including sociology, political science, psychology, and gender studies, I build a theoretical framework that emphasizes four conditions for inclusivity by minorities: a) the minority group itself; b) the outgroup; c) the outgroup attitude (e.g., thin tolerance versus thick support); and d) the extent to which societies marginalize the minority group and the outgroup. I empirically test my framework using recent European and World Values Surveys on 90 contexts (2017-2022) and multilevel regression analyses.\n","Much of the debate on migrant integration in Western European societies centers around Muslims. Public attitudes towards Muslims are rather negative and Muslims experience relatively high levels of discrimination. However, research tends to neglect the variability in attitudes towards specific subgroups of Muslims. That is, public opinion research typically assesses Islamophobia by measuring attitudes towards Muslims in general. Yet, in order to understand Islamophobia, we need to delve deeper and assess how and why attitudes may vary towards specific subgroups of Muslims. Based on two large surveys among Dutch adolescents and adults, we firstly assess to what extent Muslims are evaluated more negatively than other groups. Secondly, we assess differences in attitudes towards specific subcategories of Muslims, e.g. males versus females, young versus old, and those originating from different countries of origin. We find a clear and rather consensual hierarchy in attitudes. Firstly, in line with Ethnic Hierarchy theory and classic studies in the Netherlands, we find a consensual hierarchy in attitudes towards different groups: Muslims are evaluated more negative than Surinamese or Antilleans, with Moroccans at the lower end of the hierarchy. Moreover, we also find a hierarchical pattern in attitudes towards specific Muslim subgroups, with young and male Muslims at the bottom of the hierarchy. Finally, we test to what extent these hierarchies are shared among different social categories within the Netherlands. We discuss how these hierarchical patterns shed light on the drivers and manifestation of Islamophobia.","Given an increasing need to balance caregiving with employment, many caregivers face challenges in maintaining consistent paid work, potentially risking employment disadvantages that accumulate over the life-course. Using a life-course perspective, this study examines the impact of unpaid caregiving trajectories on mid-life employment outcomes including employment status, job satisfaction, and wages. Furthermore, we study how outcomes differ by gender and education, as some trajectories might be particularly disadvantaging for certain demographic groups. The `path-dependency’ of life-courses implies that providing care earlier in life makes it more likely to pick up caregiving later as well, often at the expense of paid work. This suggests that carer`s employment outcomes are shaped by the accumulation of multiple care episodes and their consequences, rather than by isolated instances. Thus, we build on caregiving trajectories that include both childcare and informal care episodes for up to 50 years of the life course until 2020 (N=1,630), using retrospective survey data on informal care combined with longitudinal childcare data from the LISS Panel. Using regression models and longitudinal employment information obtained from LISS, we investigate to what extent these trajectories are associated with employment status, job satisfaction, and wages across ages 45-55, and how these vary by gender and education. As providing care can be in conflict with employment, care-heavy trajectories particularly when prolonged and intensive, are expected to result in more negative employment outcomes in mid-life, with variations across demographic groups.","Tegen de achtergrond van 1) demografische ontwikkelingen, zoals de stijging van het aantal (oude) ouderen en (daarmee) het aantal mensen met een chronische aandoening, 2) minder publiek betaalde zorgvoorzieningen, en 3) het beleidsstreven om meer (parttimers meer uren) en langer (verschuiving pensioenleeftijd) te werken, zal het aantal werkenden met mantelzorgtaken de komende jaren toenemen. Uit SCP onderzoek blijkt dat nu al circa twee miljoen mensen een betaalde baan met mantelzorgtaken combineren; het gaat over 31% van de werkende vrouwen en 22% van de werkende mannen. Arbeid, onderwijs, langdurige zorg en mantelzorg komen in het leven van burgers bij elkaar; hoe deze combinatie verloopt naar gelang de levensloop, is nog onduidelijk. Om die reden onderzoeken VU en SCP in een samenwerkingsverband welke werkende mantelzorgers (geen) problemen ervaren met de combinatie van werk en zorg, en hoe dit verschilt per levensfase (16-34, 34-54, 54+). Op basis van SCP Informele Zorg 2019 en met behulp van latente klasse analyse worden levensfase-specifieke profielen opgesteld van werkende mantelzorgers. Input voor de latente klasse analyse zijn levensfase, kenmerken van de werk- en zorgsituatie en positieve en negatieve uitkomsten van de combinatie werken en zorgen. De resultaten geven inzicht in wat belangrijker is voor ervaren belasting – de werk- of de zorgsituatie - en of de combinatie in sommige levensfasen als zwaarder belastend wordt ervaren dan in andere. Waar nodig worden ook verschillen naar gender beschreven. ","In vergrijzende samenlevingen wordt het steeds belangrijker dat buren op elkaar kunnen rekenen voor hulp wanneer ze niet meer in staat zijn om een taak zelf uit te voeren. Bij dit soort hulp (ook wel mantelzorg) speelt wederkerigheid een belangrijke rol. Hulp teruggeven kan echter lastig zijn voor mensen met gezondheidsproblemen. Als de motivatie om buren te helpen grotendeels op wederkerigheid zou berusten, is de kans klein dat mensen bereid zijn mantelzorg te bieden aan hun buren. In dit onderzoek beantwoorden we de vraag in hoeverre wederkerigheid een rol speelt in het verlenen van mantelzorg aan buren. Daarbij gaan we ook in op eerdere (mantel)zorgervaringen. Uit eerder onderzoek blijkt immers dat mensen die al eens mantelzorg hebben verleend een grotere kans hebben om dat opnieuw te doen. Mogelijk zouden deze ervaringen ook de rol van wederkerigheid kunnen verkleinen. Negatieve ervaringen met mantelzorg zouden daarentegen de rol van wederkerigheid kunnen vergroten. Om dit te onderzoeken combineren we twee enquêtes onder het LISS panel, namelijk een retrospectieve vragenlijst over mantelzorgervaringen en een vignettenexperiment over hulp aan buren (met gezondheidsproblemen) waarin wederkerigheid één van de dimensies is. Ons sample bestaat uit 1343 vignetten onder 882 respondenten. Voorlopige resultaten wijzen uit dat mensen een grotere bereidheid hebben om mantelzorg te bieden aan buren wanneer ze dachten ooit hulp terug te krijgen. Dit was echter alleen het geval wanneer mensen eerdere mantelzorgervaringen hadden. Mogelijke wederkerigheid deed er niet toe wanneer men nog nooit mantelzorg verleend had.","This study aims to understand how the composition of older people’s social networks affect the uptake of public social care - either provided by (1) compensated informal caregivers or (2) professionals. Recent reforms in Dutch long-term care policies have sought to increase the involvement of social networks in the provision of care, which is reflective of an international trend of attempts to substitute professional care with cheaper alternatives. Public social care is only provided once the help of family, friends or neighbors is exhausted, in which case citizens may opt for professional care in kind or a personal budget to employ professionals or informal caregivers. The emphasis of informal care in reforms like these have been argued to perpetuate socio-economic and gender inequalities, as women and unemployed people are more likely to take on (compensated or uncompensated) informal caregiving tasks, including the associated burdens and precariousness. We therefore expect that citizens with a higher availability of women and unemployed people in their network are less likely to receive public professional care, but more likely to receive (financially compensated) informal care. To test these assumptions we will use registry data from Statistics Netherlands from 2015-2022, which allows us to measure public care receipt and to identify networks of family and neighbors of all older-aged individuals in the Netherlands. Moreover, we are able to identify the financially compensated informal caregivers, which enables us to more precisely test with whom the care recipient is most likely to form or maintain an informal care tie.","De steeds groter wordende vraag naar langdurige zorg kan oudere Nederlanders en hun naasten voor grote uitdagingen stellen. Publieke zorgvoorziening is beperkt, maar ook families worden kleiner. Daarom is het belangrijk voor ouderen met een zorgvraag dat verschillende leden van hun sociale netwerk mantelzorg verlenen, niet alleen partners en kinderen, maar ook andere familieleden of vrienden. Wij weten echter nog weinig over hoe sociale netwerken zorgnetwerken opbouwen. Met dit onderzoek willen wij analyseren hoe verschillende kenmerken van sociale netwerken beïnvloeden welk type zorg ouderen krijgen. Hierbij gaat het om de omvang, de compositie en de kwaliteit van het netwerk. Dit wordt onderzocht met hulp van een sample van de Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA), dat bestaat uit 18252 observaties uit de jaren 1992 tot 2022 van 4859 thuiswonende Nederlandse ouderen. Hiermee hebben wij typische zorgnetwerken in Nederland geïdentificeerd en 7 groepen gevonden (zorg door kinderen, partners, andere familieleden, andere netwerkleden, formele zorg en privé betaalde zorg). Eerste resultaten laten zien dat ouderen met een groter netwerk meer mantelzorg ontvangen, maar dat vooral de compositie van het netwerk belangrijk is: Partners en kinderen die in de buurt wonen en spelen de belangrijkste rol in een zorgnetwerk. Opvallend is dat het hebben van netwerkleden die veel emotionele steun bieden niet per se leidt tot mantelzorg. Dit komt mogelijk omdat ouderen hun naasten niet teveel willen belasten.","Er wordt steeds nadrukkelijker verwacht dat zorg- en welzijnsprofessionals mantelzorgers actief betrekken, ondersteunen en met hen samenwerken. In de praktijk is het echter niet altijd vanzelfsprekend dat goede samenwerkingsrelaties tot stand komen. In deze kwalitatieve studie zijn 37 mantelzorgers eerst individueel geïnterviewd. Daarna namen zij deel aan acht focusgroepen waarin de voorkeuren van mantelzorgers ten aanzien van samenwerking met professionals zijn verkend. Omdat er een groeiend besef is dat professionals hun werkwijze zouden moeten afstemmen op de individuele omstandigheden van mantelzorgers, is in het onderzoek een intersectioneel perspectief toegepast om de relatie tussen sociale posities van mantelzorgers en hun voorkeuren ten aanzien van samenwerking te onderzoeken. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat de meeste zorgen van mantelzorgers rond samenwerking voortkomen uit de organisatorische contexten waarin interacties tussen hen en professionals plaatsvinden. Verschillende sociale posities van mantelzorgers – zoals hun leeftijd, sociaal economische positie en het al dan niet hebben van een migratieachtergrond – leiden niet zozeer tot verschillende wensen ten aanzien van samenwerking met professionals. Mantelzorgers willen echter wel dat professionals oog hebben voor hun sociale posities, omdat die de context vormen van waaruit mantelzorg wordt gegeven en dus (mede) bepalen hoe gemakkelijk mantelzorgers het geven van zorg kunnen integreren in hun leven. Om samenwerking tussen mantelzorgers en professionals te verbeteren, moeten professionals aangemoedigd worden om mantelzorgers te zien en erkennen als gelijkwaardige partners in de zorg. Het is essentieel dat professionals manieren zoeken om samen zorg vorm te geven en daarbij bestaande relaties tussen mantelzorgers en zorgvragers centraal stellen.","Oudere zorgontvangers verschillen in de soorten zorg die ze krijgen: sommigen krijgen vooral partnerzorg of andere vormen van informele zorg, terwijl anderen vooral gebruik maken van formele of particulier betaalde zorg. Dit kan bijdragen aan verschillen in welbevinden. Door Self-Determination Theory toe te passen op de zorgcontext, veronderstellen we dat typen zorgnetwerken verschillen in de mate waarin ze de gevoelens van verbondenheid, autonomie en competentie van de zorgontvanger bevorderen, wat verschillen in welbevinden van zorgontvangers in verschillende zorg netwerken zou kunnen verklaren. We gebruiken gegevens, afkomstig uit tien observaties van de Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (N= 18.434 observaties van 4.837 oudere Nederlandse volwassenen, van 1992 tot 2022), om dit te onderzoeken.  Zorgnetwerktypen zijn a priori samengesteld uit (voornamelijk) partner, informele, formele of particulier betaalde zorg.  Mixed-model regressieanalyse van depressieve symptomen als maat voor welbevinden wordt toegepast op zorgnetwerktype. Het ontvangen van zorg van een partner-zorgnetwerk draagt het meest bij aan het welbevinden. Degenen met een formeel zorgnetwerk zijn het slechtste af. Eenzaamheid en zorg toereikendheid verklaren deze verschillen gedeeltelijk.","The results of the Dutch 2023 parliamentary elections sent shock waves around the world as the populist radical right, anti-Muslim, Party for Freedom, won by a large margin. This latest victory has left many Dutch Muslims wondering at their place in the Netherlands further eroding their already low trust in the Dutch government. Despite however the political salience of Islam in the Netherlands, little is still known about how the political participation of Muslims is informed by Islam, especially for those who have been socialized in Europe. \n This work investigates this relationship, through the analyses of 33 semi-structured interviews of 2nd and 3rd generation Turkish and Moroccan Dutch. Where there are a lot of similarities between those with a Moroccan and those with a Turkish background such as migration history and religion, there are many differences in terms of religious, ethnic and political organization. Furthermore, the practice of Islam is often gendered. Therefore how Islamic religiosity informs political participation may differ between ethnicity and between gender. Taking these things into consideration this study contributes to the current literature by asking the following question: How does Islamic religiosity inform the political participation of Turkish and Moroccan Dutch men and women who were socialized in the Netherlands? And how are these processes gendered and related to ethnicity? \n \n We approach Islamic religiosity from a multi-dimensional perspective shedding light on how religious practice (private and communal), beliefs and religious identity can differentially inform why and how individual Muslims participate. Results pertaining to group differences still to come.\n \n","This paper explores the mechanisms through which emotional and attitudinal dispositions combined together translate into the political actions of “vote” (electoral participation) and “voice” (protest participation). We ask: how do emotions, in conjunction with political trust and political efficacy, lead to different forms of political participation? We conceptualize political trust and efficacy and their presumed effects on voting and protesting. We then turn to discuss the role of discrete emotions (anger, contempt, hope, anxiety) and the relationship between emotions and political participation. We particularly zoom in on the role of anger and contempt because we expect that, combined with citizens’ levels of efficacy and trust, their effects on political participation differ – the relationships depend on the type of participation (voting or protesting). We test those relationships separately for the respondents who are nested in three different ideological categories, namely left-wing, right-wing, and moderate citizens. We use a dataset of 6 different countries – Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Poland – to test our hypotheses in those different political contexts.","Dit artikel onderzoekt hoe anti-institutionele groeperingen in Nederland zich verhouden tot het gevestigde politieke landschap op basis van 69 thematisch geanalyseerde nieuwsberichten van anti-institutionele nieuwswebsites en een casestudie: de negatieve reactie van de anti-institutionele nieuwswebsites op de recentelijke verkiezingsoverwinning van de PVV. Anti-institutioneel extremisme in Nederland is sinds 2023 gedefinieerd door de AIVD als een groepering van mensen die geloven dat er in Nederland en internationaal een kwaadaardige, ongedefinieerde elite aan de macht is die het onderdrukken van de gewone mens tot doel heeft. Net zoals bij populistische vijandbeelden is het narratief open qua invulling, thematiek en grieven, waardoor er een groot aantal verschillende grieven in kunnen worden ondergebracht.  \n \n Hoewel er overeenkomsten zijn tussen het anti-institutionele en het populistische narratief, en de PVV aan verschillende grieven raakt die vaak door de anti-institutionele organisaties worden geuit, sluit het milieu zich niet aan bij het populisme van de PVV. Bijna alle geanalyseerde organisaties wezen de PVV-overwinning in de afgelopen verkiezing bijna meteen af in meerderde gepubliceerde artikelen op hun websites. Dit komt gedeeltelijk doordat een verkiezingsoverwinning niet aansluit bij het narratief van onderdrukking. Hiernaast vinden anti-institutionele organisaties de PVV te mild op specifieke onderwerpen die zij belangrijk vinden, zoals vaccinatie en de Great Reset, en steunen zij overwegend Forum voor Democratie, dat wel actief tegemoetkomt aan deze specifieke grieven. Hoewel het vaak lijkt alsof anti-systeem narratieven niet specifiek zijn, door het groot aantal verschillende grieven dat erin is ondergebracht, zijn er in werkelijkheid grote verschillen tussen de verschillende stromingen. \n","We introduce a new dataset examining the political behaviours and attitudes of Italian students approaching their first voting experience. Framed within the \"Schools\" work package of the POSTGEN project, we set out to investigate the initial attribution and definition of political meanings among secondary school students using a digitally administered survey that blends traditional and gamified elements to approximately 1,000 students from 20 secondary schools across different areas of the Italian territory. The dataset provides several information pertaining to diverse domains of sociology and political science. First, building on the framework of issue yield theory (De Sio & Weber, 2014), it gathers opinions on a wide range of important socioeconomic and sociocultural issues characterising the Italian public debate, including climate change attitudes, populist and stealth democratic attitudes, and attitudes towards sexism. Second, we leverage an innovative \"Swipe\" module to measure popularity/approval of a wide array of politicians and social media influencers, thereby minimizing survey fatigue and enabling data linkage between students' social media usage and influencers’ online activity. Third, we exploit the nested structure of the dataset by providing school-level contextual characteristics related to socioeconomic and political characteristics of districts. Employing a sampling strategy aimed at covering the different school-tracks of the Italian educational system and reaching students regardless of their political engagement, this dataset not only aims to enrich our understanding of youth political participation but also introduces an innovative data linkage strategy that will allow nuanced insights into social media behaviour and political engagement among young people.","In het voortgezet onderwijs (vo) vormen docenten wat etnische achtergrond betreft geen afspiegeling van de leerling- en beroepsbevolking. Onderzoek laat zien dat diverse onderwijsteams van grote waarde zijn voor leerlingen en onderwijsprofessionals. Zo kan het gelijke kansen bevorderen. Wat zijn mogelijke verklaringen voor de ondervertegenwoordiging in het vo van docenten van kleur? En hoe kunnen scholen meer docenten van kleur aantrekken en ervoor zorgen dat zij zich thuis (blijven) voelen in het onderwijs? Voion, het arbeidsmarkt- en opleidingsfonds voor het voortgezet onderwijs, heeft kwalitatief onderzoek laten uitvoeren om deze vragen te beantwoorden. Uit interviews met 15 docenten van kleur die werkzaam zijn (of zijn geweest) in het voortgezet onderwijs komt een aantal thema’s naar voren die een rol spelen bij uitstroom. Hoge werkdruk is zo’n thema; docenten van kleur werken relatief vaak op scholen met een etnisch diverse leerlingpopulatie en met veel leerlingen met het risico op leerachterstanden. Dit stelt docenten voor extra uitdagingen. Andere thema’s zijn ongelijke behandeling van leerlingen van kleur en docenten van kleur en het ontbreken van structureel diversiteitsbeleid op de school. Aanbevelingen zijn dan ook het vergroten van ondersteuning, het ontwikkelen van een professionele aanspreekcultuur en aandacht voor vieringen uit andere culturen.","Societal processes and public opinion can affect whether employers take action and which policy measures they choose to boost diversity, equal opportunities and inclusion, and to reduce discrimination in the workplace. Yet, public opinion regarding workplace diversity initiatives (other than affirmative action) has so far received little scholarly attention, especially in Europe. This study sheds light on public attitudes towards three different, commonly applied types of workplace diversity policies, and examines which individual-level and national-level conditions shape public support. We use large-scale, representative survey data from two pooled waves of the Eurobarometer, covering 38,009 citizens across 26 European countries. We enrich these data with information on national-level income inequality as well as countries’ labor market and antidiscrimination legislation and policies. Results show significant differences in public support across the three types of policies, with the strongest support for diversity training, followed closely by monitoring recruitment procedures, whereas support for monitoring workforce composition is clearly lower. This is in line with the idea that support tends to be lower for more preferential and prescriptive workplace policies. Furthermore, we find that, in addition to individual-level factors – particularly gender, ethnic minority group membership, personal experiences with discrimination, prejudice, intergroup contact and political orientation – national-level conditions are important antecedents of public support for workplace diversity policies. That is, differences in public attitudes regarding such policies are also shaped by country-level income inequalities, people’s perceptions of how widespread discrimination and unequal opportunities are in society, and national-level laws and policies to fight unequal opportunities.","Levels of exclusion of ethno-religious immigrants among the majority population vary strongly across European countries. This study addresses the question whether these variations are related to differences in immigrant integration policies and welfare policies across Europe. We argue that both policies need to be considered simultaneously, given the development of integration policies within historical frameworks of pre-existing welfare regimes, and expect that policies may set intergroup norms discouraging exclusion of ethno-religious immigrants. Using data from the European Social Survey, enriched with information on immigrant integration policies and welfare policies related to the labour market, we only find a negative association between welcoming integration policies and ethno-religious exclusionism, yet not for more generous welfare policies. Additionally, we hypothesize that the relationship between governmental policies and exclusionism might be weaker for people in economic precarious positions as compared to their more privileged counterparts, because people in such precarious positions face more intergroup competition and perceive more intergroup threat. Our findings show that exposure to more welcoming integration policies is less strongly negatively associated with exclusion of ethno-religious immigrants for some economic precarious groups (i.e., for lowly educated and low income groups) but not for others (i.e., for unemployed people and those living under economic strain). Exposure to more generous welfare policies is unrelated with exclusion of ethno-religious immigrants for both people in precarious and non-precarious positions.","Introduction: Poverty is often associated with social stigma and trauma, potentially shaping negative emotions. While research has focused primarily on shame in poverty, other emotions are often overlooked. Furthermore, shame is not static and can lead to additional negative emotions over time. As a result, emotions related to shame remain largely unexplored, potentially overlooking the full complexity of poverty-related emotions and their consequences. This has led to the following main research question How do emotions shaped by the experience of poverty change over the life course?\n Methods: 34 life story interviews were conducted with people who had experienced poverty at some point in their lives, using Wengraf's biographical narrative interpretation method. The interviews were analysed using Labov's narrative method with the help of an expert by experience. Theories from the sociology of emotions, including Turner, Scheff, and Hochschild, were borrowed to explore not only how emotions change, but also how emotions are shaped by interactions and the social structures to which emotions are attributed in the experience of poverty. Two composite narratives were created.\n Results: Analyses show that while poverty, mainly through interactions, initially evokes shame, over time the emotion evolves into (related) negative emotions such as anger, fear, and sadness, creating emotional traps. With this transformation, the direction of the emotions also changes, as shame, initially directed inward at the self, becomes frustration directed outward at social structures. This eventually leads to withdrawal from social structures such as support systems and society as a whole.\n","This paper analyzes how the experience of beauty – that is, the aesthetic appreciation of physical appearance -- is shaped by race. The analysis is based on Q-sort interviews (Kuipers, 2015) with a stratified sample of 150 people from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK. The quantitative analysis of the Q-sort data clearly showed strongly racialized patterns that are surprisingly consistent across the five countries; and that did not always emerge clearly in the interview materials due to a taboo on race. The interviews show that beauty tastes are characterized by what Bonillo-Silva called “racialized emotions”: strongly affective responses to (the beauty of) differently racialized categories. In contrast with expectations derived from earlier, mostly American, research, informants on average found Black and Mediterranean men and women more beautiful than average, and Asian and Nordic men and women less so. The paper provides in-depth – and potentially rather discomforting – discussion of the racialized repertoires that come to the surface in these aesthetic experiences. These racialized emotions can be traced back to old historical roots: the European imperialist expansion that was legitimated by racial hierarchies, but also the formation of European nation-states that linked political and social rights and identities to common ancestry, which could be seen in specific national or ethnic ‘looks’. I conclude by pointing to the similarities between beauty and race: both are located in people’s physique, are imbued with emotions, and – to a large part because of the emotional power -- have a strong social presence and real consequences that are typically suppressed, ignored or downplayed.","his study analyses how the doing of emotions is negotiated in sex advice media aimed at couples. It takes the case of Dutch reality series Sex Academy to explore how its display and discussion of feelings offers various cultural idea(l)s about enacting couple intimacy. Sex Academy follows a make-over format in which couples ‘boost’ their sex lives through advice sessions, workshops, and assignments. Typical of mainstream sex advice, it emphasises the importance of feelings of romance and sensuality in relationships, thus promoting feeling norms that foster heteronormative coupledom. Yet, existing studies rarely take into account how participants may not only reproduce but also challenge and contest such feeling norms. This study turns its focus to the interactions among partners and between participants and presenters to analyse how intimate feeling repertoires are negotiated. These feeling repertoires comprise a set of possible ways of expressing and experiencing emotions in committed relationships. This study argues that such an approach allows for a better understanding of the ways mainstream sex advice may consolidate but also challenge heteronormative notions of relationship intimacy.","In Flanders, Belgium, the gap in school outcomes between monolingual majority youngsters and multilingual minoritized youngsters is among the highest in the OECD. In this presentation, we introduce the JEZ-to-Emotions project, which articulates a novel approach to understanding these educational gaps that centers on children’s emotional competence (EC) – i.e. the ability to perceive, understand and regulate emotions. We pay specific attention to the role that teachers play in shaping pupils’ EC. Although teachers increasingly recognize the importance of emotions in education, the potential bias in socializing EC at school remains largely overlooked. Based on insights from various scientific disciplines such as developmental and cultural psychology, sociology of language and education and linguistics, we argue that multilingual minoritized pupils may not equally benefit from teachers' emotion-related socialization behaviors (ERSBs) since their emotional experiences are inherently different from those of majority monolinguals due to their engagement in multiple languages ànd cultural contexts. As such, teachers’ well-intended practices to foster EC may actually reinforce ethnic and linguistic gaps that plague education. In this presentation, we will review the state-of-the-art leading up three research objectives that could lead to future ERSBs promoting EC in all children: (1) explore what multilingual pupils understand by EC, (2) identify how multilingual minoritized pupils’ EC, perceived ERSBs of teachers and school outcomes are related, and (3) identify which conditions improve teachers’ effectiveness as socialization agents of multilingual minoritized pupils’ EC.","Qualitative methods are a set of data collection and analytic strategies that cohere around a shared emphasis on the interpretive and meaning-laden aspects of social life, including emotional experiences and social behavior in work settings. Attending to meaning-making in real settings among actual interactants promises to offer “rich rigor” and contextualized information about emotions in the workplace deemed salient and important to workers themselves (Tracy, 2010). In our review of qualitative studies into emotional labour and regulation, we take Hochschild’s (1983) now classic work on the commercialization of feelings in the context of the airline industry as a starting point. Hochschild provided a sociological look at how corporations increasingly encroach on worker feelings and sense of self in order to maximize corporate gains. Some research that builds on Hochschild’s work can reduce her analysis to individual strategies without appreciating the wider context of mid-century American capitalism in which her analysis is embedded. This lack of context is partly a methodological artifact, as quantitative analyses that reduce emotional labor to one variable among many are, by their nature, susceptible to overlooking the broader sociological conditions in which emotion management processes take place. Qualitative studies of emotional labor and emotion regulation in the workplace are thus critical for continuing to contextualize these processes, reassess their salience and forms in a variety of jobs, and consider how diverse workers, through labor revitalization and/or social media, might resist feelings rules, alienation, and the commercialization of feelings. We summarize core qualitative methods for data collection and analysis in emotional labor research, including ethnographic, interview, and focus group data collection methods, as well as grounded theory and abductive analytic approaches, and give directions for future qualitative research on emotional labour.","While harassment awareness trainings centering on mechanisms of male domination are an effective tool for advancing gender equality, this approach is not universally adopted. Deciphering what leads policymakers and professionals to employ feminist vocabularies and gender-based perspectives is important for our scholarly understanding of how policy solutions come about, and for practitioners championing gender equality policy. Based on an interview-based and ethnographic study of anti-street harassment trainings by the Dutch organization Qpido, this article analyzes an understudied and undertheorized source of obstruction to the use of feminist knowledge and gender-based vocabularies in policy: professionals’ and policymakers’ apprehension of moralizing. During interviews and meetings in which they discussed what sort of tone and angle should be employed in awareness trainings on street harassment, policymakers and professionals in Amsterdam explained they wanted to avoid messages that were “too confrontational” in favor of campaigns that “incite discussion.” I draw from emotion scholarship to conceptualize this apprehension as a moral emotion characterized by anxiety about inappropriately imposing a moral judgment or attitude. Considering apprehension of moralizing contributes to our understanding of why policymakers and professionals avoid feminist vocabularies pertaining to structural gender inequalities, in favor of more individual-oriented policies on sexual violence—a shift that occurred in the Netherlands and other national contexts. The article discusses the concept’s applicability to other national contexts and types of social relations and its broader scientific and political implications.","Succesvolle arbeidsmarktintegratie van statushouders (vluchtelingen met een verblijfsvergunning) vraagt inzet en aanpassing van nieuwkomers, gemeenten en werkgevers. De Inburgeringswet bepaalt dat statushouders o.a. taalcursussen en het inburgeringsexamen doen. Gemeenten ontwikkelen beleid om statushouders aan het werk te helpen, bijvoorbeeld via opleidingstrajecten en werkervaringsplaatsen. Toch blijft de arbeidsmarktparticipatie van statushouders in Nederland, en vooral in het Noorden, achter. \n \n Naast welbekende oorzaken zoals taalachterstanden wijst onderzoek uit dat werkgevers contracten vaak niet verlengen omdat statushouders niet goed ‘passen’. Dit kan komen door een gebrekkige ‘person-job’ en/of ‘person-organization fit'. De oorzaken hiervoor worden vaak gezocht aan de kant van de statushouder, terwijl deze ook bij de werkgever kunnen liggen of de gemeentelijke professional die de statushouder naar werk bemiddelt.\n \n In dit paper ligt de nadruk op de rol van gemeentelijke professionals als cruciale schakel in de bemiddeling van statushouders naar werk. We beschrijven een transdisciplinair project dat beoogt bij te dragen aan de duurzame en passende arbeidsmarktparticipatie van statushouders door het faciliteren van een goede ‘match’ tussen statushouder en werkgever. Dit doen wij in co-creatie met werkgevers, gemeenten en statushouders in de arbeidsmarktregio Groningen en Noord-Drenthe. \n \n We presenteren het ‘statushouder-werkgever-fit model’ en beargumenteren het belang van een realistisch tolerantie perspectief daarin op basis van psychologische en sociologische theorie, een literatuurscan, een vragenlijst onder professionals en focusgroepen met statushouders, werkgevers en professionals. We beschrijven vervolgens de ontwikkeling en inhoud van twee evidence-and theory-based interventies voor gemeentelijke professionals - een training en toolbox - en hoe we hun effect monitoren en evalueren en aanpassingen doen.","Sinds de Russische invasie van Oekraïne hebben miljoenen Oekraïners hun toevlucht gezocht in Europa, van wie meer dan honderdduizend in Nederland. Voor deze Oekraïense vluchtelingen is de nooit eerder gebruikte Europese Richtlijn Tijdelijke Bescherming (RTB) geactiveerd. Onder de Nederlandse implementatie van de RTB zijn Oekraïners onderworpen aan beleid dat omschreven kan worden als ‘work first’, met directe toegang tot de arbeidsmarkt zonder inburgeringsplicht. Dit wijkt af van de reguliere ‘settle first’ benadering voor andere vluchtelingengroepen die na een opvangperiode en statusverlening een verplicht inburgeringstraject moeten volgen. Deze afwijkende beleidscondities creëren de unieke mogelijkheid om de impact van ‘work first’ ten opzichte van ‘settle first’ beleid op de arbeidsmarktpositie van vluchtelingen te onderzoeken. In dit proefschriftvoorstel stel ik vergelijkingen tussen verschillende vluchtelingengroepen in verschillende contexten voor om hier grip op te krijgen. Deze vergelijkingen omvatten naast Oekraïners ten opzichte van Syriërs in Nederland, ook Oekraïners in Nederland ten opzichte van dezelfde groep in Duitsland. Voor deze vergelijkingen maak ik gebruik van grootschalige representatieve longitudinale survey data, verzameld door een consortium van het WODC, CBS, EUR en RIVM. Voor de vergelijking met Oekraïners in Duitsland wordt vergelijkbare longitudinale IAB-BAMF-SOEP data geanalyseerd. Naast deze comparatieve studies stel ik een een mixed methods studie voor die zich richt op Oekraïners met een meer kwetsbare arbeidsmarktpositie in Nederland. Op deze wijze hoop ik met mijn proefschrift bij te dragen aan kennis rondom startposities en vroege ontwikkelingen in de arbeidsmarktpositie van vluchtelingen, en in het bijzonder, welke rol beleid hierin speelt.","In januari 2022 trad de nieuwe Wet inburgering in werking, als reactie op tekortkomingen uit de vorige wet. Binnen deze nieuwe wet kregen gemeenten opnieuw de verantwoordelijkheid voor het aanbod en de monitoring van de inburgeringstrajecten voor nieuwkomers. Om beter aan te sluiten bij de capaciteiten en behoeften van nieuwkomers zijn er voortaan bovendien drie verschillende ‘routes’ naar inburgering (B1, Z- en onderwijs-route). De wet is ingestoken als ‘lerend en adaptief stelsel’. Uit eerder onderzoek weten we dat beleid een rol kan spelen in de positieverwerving van nieuwkomers, met name binnen de eerste periode na aankomst, is het van belang de werking van dit nieuwe beleid te evalueren. Tegen die achtergrond doen we in Rotterdam vier jaar lang onderzoek naar de opzet, uitvoering en resultaten van het nieuwe inburgeringsbeleid.Kwalitatief onderzoek onder betrokkenen toont algemene steun voor het nieuwe beleid. Tegelijkertijd werden naast opstartproblemen ook meer structurele knelpunten gesignaleerd. We constateerden dat de werelden van opvang en integratie nog steeds te veel van elkaar gescheiden zijn, en de vraag rijst of de inburgering niet te ingewikkeld is geworden door de vele ‘stations’ die nieuwkomers nu moeten passeren. Ook zijn er zorgen over het verschil in beleid voor gezinsmigranten en de rol van (arbeidsmarkt)participatie binnen en naast de inburgering. Deze knelpunten vragen aandacht van de nationale en lokale overheden, maar bieden ook aanknopingspunten voor het bestuderen en verbeteren van (inburgerings)beleid in andere landen.","Oorlog, conflict, geweld en vervolging dwingen mensen hun thuis te ontvluchten en zich in nieuwe maatschappijen te vestigen. Hoe bouwen vluchtelingen hun leven opnieuw op? Hebben zij invloed op dit proces, zijn zij vrij om te beslissen hoe hun leven vorm krijgt, en spelen andere contextuele factoren een rol? Terwijl veel bekend is over de maatschappelijke posities van vluchtelingen en de factoren die hun integratie beïnvloeden, weten we minder over welke aspiraties   vluchtelingen zelf hebben en hoe deze een rol spelen bij het vinden van een plek in hun nieuwe maatschappij. \nOm deze kenniskloof aan te pakken, wordt er etnografisch onderzoek gedaan naar de vestigingsprocessen van statushouders in Rotterdam. We volgen een groep van ongeveer 15 statushouders van begin tot het einde van hun inburgeringstraject. Hierin kijken we naar in hoeverre het statushouders lukt om hun eigen aspiraties te realiseren en welke rol het inburgeringsbeleid van Rotterdam speelt hierin.","Statushouders benadrukken het belang van het beheersen van de Nederlandse taal voor hun integratie in de samenleving. Het is een sleutel tot werk, sociale contacten en een zelfstandig bestaan. In deze studie gaan we bij Syrische statushouders na welke factoren de ontwikkeling in de Nederlandse taalbeheersing beïnvloeden. We hebben daarbij aandacht voor het inburgerings- en opvangbeleid en individuele factoren. Het Nederlandse inburgeringsbeleid staat voor een belangrijk deel in het teken van het leren van de Nederlandse taal. Ons onderzoek kan inzicht geven of het streven naar een hoger taalniveau in de inburgering op termijn tot een gunstigere ontwikkeling leidt in de Nederlandse taalverwerving. Naast het inburgeringsbeleid richten we ons op de relatie tussen het opvangbeleid en taalverwerving. Er loopt al enige tijd een discussie over aanpassingen in het opvangbeleid, waarin meer mogelijkheden voor het leren van de Nederlandse taal en participatie zijn voorzien. In deze studie willen we nagaan in hoeverre kenmerken van het opvangbeleid van betekenis zijn voor ontwikkelingen in de taalverwerving. Voor beide beleidsfactoren zijn we geïnteresseerd in de werking op de korte en op de wat langere termijn. Eerder onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat het afronden van de inburgering en het kunnen participeren in de opvang bijdraagt aan de Nederlandse taalverwerving, maar het is niet duidelijk in hoeverre de effecten van deze factoren zich opstapelen of juist afvlakken. Verder onderzoeken we verschillende achtergrondkenmerken, omdat eerder onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat oudere mensen en degenen met lagere opleidingsniveaus doorgaans meer moeite hebben om hogere niveaus van taalvaardigheid te bereiken","Stadsvergroening staat in de spotlight, en wordt gezien als hefboom voor een groene, gezonde, veerkrachtige en sociale stad. Er is een groeiend besef van de positieve effecten van groen in de stad op duurzaamheid en klimaatadaptatie, (mentale) gezondheid en welzijn en sociale contacten en netwerken in de stad.\n Naast een groeiend besef en gevoel van urgentie over het belang van stadsnatuur, groeit ook het bewustzijn dat toegang tot en betrokkenheid bij stadsnatuur ongelijk verdeeld is. Wetenschappers noemen bijvoorbeeld het risico op ‘green exclusivity’ en ‘green gentrification’ en ook natuurorganisaties en lokale overheden spreken steeds vaker over ‘groene kansenongelijkheid’. Het is dus belangrijk om een inclusiever beeld te krijgen van wat stadsnatuur voor verschillende groepen betekent en hoe ze erbij kunnen worden betrokken. \n \n In een actiegericht en multi-method promotieproject met lokale gemeenschappen en beleidsmakers onderzoek ik de veranderingen die nodig zijn op weg naar een groene, gezonde leefomgeving voor en door iedereen. Daarbij combineer ik inzichten uit de sociologie, governance en public health. \n \n In het eerste gedeelte van het onderzoek staan de inwoners van Rotterdam-Zuid centraal. Hoe kijken zij naar de stadsvergroening en stadsvergroeningsinitiatieven? Wat vinden ze belangrijk, waar is behoefte aan en waarom? Hoe zijn inwoners betrokken bij bestaande initiatieven, welke drempels ervaren ze en wat is er nodig voor inclusieve community-based initiatieven?\n \n In deze sessie deel ik de onderzoeksplannen en ga ik graag in gesprek over de beoogde onderzoeksvragen, methoden en het theoretisch kader.\n \n Auteur: Marije van der Kruk\n Department of Public Administration and Sociology, Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences \n","Advances in digital technologies are transforming how European cities are managed, planned and governed. Urban Digital Twins (UDTs), or technologies aimed at virtually replicating cities, are hailed for their potential to enhance the efficiency of management processes. Cities across Europe increasingly invest in digital infrastructures like UDTs in the expectation that such technologies enable us to see, experience and interact with the urban environment in new and exciting ways. \n Scholarly attempts to grasp the significance of this emerging phenomenon are hampered by technical determinism and techno-optimism. Existing literature on UDTs tends to overly focus on definitional questions while offering a rather descriptive account of applications that ignores potential tensions or conflicts. In this paper, we circumvent these pitfalls by combining insights from urban sociology, STS and political science to shed new light on UDTs as ‘incipient regimes of visibility’. \n By tracing the development of UDTs in Rotterdam and The Hague, we investigate how UDTs constitute a virtual order of things that determines which urban processes, spaces, experiences, and communities ‘count’ – or are left unaccounted for – in the digital representation of city life. Based on extensive qualitative research, we show that the meaning of UDTs is volatile and context-dependent, that technological and socio-technological challenges hamper their development and implementation, and that bureaucrats’ internal and external expectations diverge. Extending the lessons learned, we argue that UDTs are still ambiguous as incipient regimes of visibility and that ‘future thinking’ about UDTs needs to coincide with critical thinking about questions of inclusivity and participation. \n \n Keywords: Urban Digital Twins, Smart Urbanism, Visibility, Digitalization, Urban Sociology\n \n","Despite ongoing discussions about the benefits of women in the leadership of work organizations, there exists little quantifiable evidence to what degree female managers’ presence benefits workers’ well-being. Recent qualitative evidence suggests that female managers are more supportive of work-family balance than male managers (van Hek & van der Lippe, 2022). The central research question of this study is: \n To what extent does the increase in the relative number of female managers in small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) lead to a lower prevalence of long-term sick leave among employees?\n \n In short, our argumentation is that female managers are associated with less mental-health related sickness absence because of support for work-family balance due to managers’ own experiences with work-family conflict. We therefore expect a negative association between female managers and mental-health related long-term sickness absence among employees, especially when: employees are female and new and single parents, when female managers have children themselves and in small organizations (more direct link between managers and employees).\n \n We employ an innovative study design using linked employer-employee longitudinal population microdata from the Netherlands. This overcomes major limitations of surveys in studying work & health (e.g. selection, response, and social desirability biases). Using linked data, we investigate how female managers in SME organizations (Dutch: MKB) impact the incidence of mental-health-related long-term sickness absence among employees. We employ dynamic workplace panel analyses to establish a causal effect and explore heterogeneities along employee gender & parenthood of employees, parenthood of managers, and organization size. \n","There is a growing scholarly interest in the pivotal role that employer policies play in shaping social inequality. Particularly, employer orientation (EO), i.e. how employers combine wage policy and the use of non-standard employment (NSE), may influence social disparities as they influence inequalities regarding job security and income. Previous empirical research on employer policies has mostly focused on either wage policy or the use of NSE. Research on how employers combine this is mostly theoretical. These studies usually distinguish between two types of orientations: external and internal. Externally oriented entities base their policies on the fluctuating dynamics of supply and demand within the labour market, and often use NSE and performance-based wages. Internally oriented firms more often use permanent contracts and offer their employees a continuously increasing wage based on administrative rules such as wage scales. \n \n To our knowledge, this study is the first to empirically investigate how employers combine wage policy and the use of NSE. To do so, we use register data on employment from Statistics Netherlands linked to the structure of earnings survey. Since employer orientation is a multi-dimensional concept, we employ Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to cluster employers with similar orientations. Using LCA enables us to explore ways in which employers combine wage policy and the use of NSE beyond the two types that are commonly distinguished in the theoretical literature. In addition, we explore how firm size, sector, whether a firm is a multinational, and labour union activity influence a firm’s EO.","A growing body of research has shown that employee turnover behavior can be contagious and spreads within workplaces. This could induce turnover spirals that result in increased workloads, loss of control, and discontent for remaining employees. Yet, research on the impact of co-worker and manager behaviors on employee turnover is novel and knowledge on underlying social processes remains narrow. To detect, prevent and manage situations in which multiple employees might leave at once, this article examines effects of co-worker and manager behaviors on employee job searches, as this is the first instance in which employees engage in turnover processes  This paper is novel as it uses a multilevel data structure to move beyond individual antecedents of job searches and by examining which type of co-workers and which type of behaviors -i.e., several types of turnover behaviors and counterproductive work behaviors- are most likely to induce employee job searches. Moreover, so far existing research only assesses the impact of co-worker and manager behavior in one or two organizations, making this study a more comprehensive test of behavioral contagion mechanisms in turnover processes. Unique employer-employee linked data was collected and is now being prepared for analysis. The authors expect to present a first draft with preliminary findings at the Dag van de Sociologie.","Een grote meerderheid van de Nederlanders ervaart hun werk als betekenisvol. Vanuit de ‘public service motivation’ gedachte is werk betekenisvol wanneer het werk bijdraagt aan het welzijn van anderen (Perry & Wise, 1990; Steijn, 2006). Het ervaren van werk als betekenisvol is echter niet volledig afhankelijk van de mogelijke maatschappelijke meerwaarde ervan. Lips-Wiersma en Wright (2012) vatten het subjectieve concept betekenisvol werk met de ´comprehensive meaningful work scale’ samen in vier dimensies. Deze dimensies zijn: trouw zijn aan jezelf (zingeving die ontstaat wanneer we in of tijdens ons werk dicht bij onze persoonlijke kernwaarden blijven), eenheid met anderen (zingeving die ontstaat wanneer we in of tijdens ons werk verbonden voelen met collega’s), volledig potentieel benutten (zingeving die ontstaat wanneer we in of tijdens on werk unieke en specifieke talenten en vaardigheden ontwikkelen en inzetten), en anderen dienen (zingeving die ontstaat wanneer we in of tijdens ons werk het verschil het leven van anderen kunnen maken). Arbeidsociologisch onderzoek laat zien dat er verschillen bestaan tussen beroepsgroepen in het ervaren van betekenisvol werk (Lips-Wiersma et al, 2016; De Prins et al, 2018; Van der Aa, Van Rijn en Brinkman, 2024). Recent stellen Van der Aa, Van Rijn en Brinkman (2024) dat het ervaren van betekenisvol werk in hogere mate afhangt van de kwaliteit van arbeid (het geheel van arbeidsomstandigheden, arbeidsinhoud, arbeidsverhoudingen en arbeidsvoorwaarden) dan de bedrijfstak waarin iemand werkt. Het is voor leidinggevenden, besturen en hr-professionals belangrijk te beseffen dat goede arbeidsvoorwaarden, goede arbeidsverhoudingen, het geven van feedback, duidelijkheid in het werk, afwisseling en uitdaging in het werk belangrijke aanjagers zijn voor het ervaren van betekenisvol werk. Dit onderzoek bouwt voort op het onderzoek van Van der Aa et al, (2024) en beoogt meer inzicht te krijgen in de invloed van levensopvattingen (ook wel culturele predisposities) op het ervaren van werk als betekenisvol. Hierbij onderzoeken we de impact van hoe mensen in het leven staan op het verband tussen de kwaliteit van arbeid en betekenisvol werk. Voor de uitvoering van dit onderzoek maken we gebruik van surveydata, welke in het voorjaar van 2023 zijn verzameld door middel van een online vragenlijst onder panelleden van het NIPObase-panel van Kantar. Aan de hand van cluster- en regressieanalyse worden de hypothesen getoetst.","Er zijn grote tekorten op de arbeidsmarkt. Eén van de mogelijke oplossingen daarvoor is dat deeltijders meer uren gaan werken. Het programma Meer uren werkt!, gefinancierd door het Nationaal Groeifonds, onderzoekt en implementeert interventies om dat mogelijk te maken. Het programma richt zich op diverse drempels in de manier waarop werk georganiseerd is, in de sociale omgeving van deeltijders en bij de opvattingen en situatie van deeltijders zelf. In deze bijdrage onderzoeken we welke drempels vooral van belang zijn.\n \n We doen dat met een vignetexperiment, welke onderdeel is van de derde meting van de Sustainable Workforce Survey. Werknemers kregen 4 situaties te zien waarin zij gevraagd werden of ze in die specifieke situatie meer uren zouden willen werken. We nemen daarbij mee op welke manier de extra te werken uren gepland gaan worden, welke taken werknemers dan zullen verrichten, wat meer werken financieel oplevert en hoe veel anderen in de omgeving van deeltijders werken. Ook controleren we voor een aantal achtergrondkenmerken zoals gender en leeftijd die gemeten zijn in de survey.\n \n De voorlopige resultaten laten zien dat vooral het financiële aspect meespeelt: wanneer werknemers er financieel op achteruit gaan door meer uren te werken willen zij dat niet, en wanneer ze er op vooruit gaan juist wel. Ook het zelf kunnen plannen van de extra uren en het krijgen van extra taken zijn belangrijke redenen voor deeltijders om meer te willen werken. De sociale omgeving speelt geen rol in deze beslissing.","Most research on the careers of employees in non-standard employment (NSE) have focused on contract type and on whether employees in NSE experience a stepping-stone scenario (transitioning to a permanent contract) or a trap scenario (remaining in NSE). These studies neglect other dimensions of employment and how these different dimensions interact and cluster over the course of careers. The present study uses the multi-dimensional concept of employment precariousness (EP) to investigate the early careers of employees in NSE. Using yearly data from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel, we studied the first five years of the careers of Dutch employees who entered the labour market after having left formal education between 2008 to 2018 (N=307). EP was measured with the employment precariousness scale Europe (EPRES-E), which distinguishes five dimensions of EP: temporariness, vulnerability, disempowerment, wages and unpredictability of working times. We used mixture Hidden Markov models (MHMM) to identify ‘states’ that represent different combinations of these dimensions and thus different levels of precariousness. In addition, we studied how employees moved between these states and how this mobility is influenced by both gender and educational level. We found five states of EP and three patterns of transitioning between these states (trajectories). We distinguish between the following three trajectories: towards precariousness, towards a standard employment relationship (SER) and towards low pay and inactivity. Our research does not provide evidence for either the steppingstone or the entrapment hypothesis.","There is a general contention that work has become increasingly precarious across Europe since the 1970s. However, conclusions about the trend of precarisation are based on a fragmented body of literature which has lacked a multidimensional, longitudinal, comparative perspective of precarious employment. As a result, nuances of the trend and the empirical ground on which the conclusions are based remain unclear. Empirical enquiry into precarious employment needs a multidimensional view, because contractual insecurity is not the only way precariousness is induced in employment. The longitudinal and comparative perspective are essential in empirical studies if we want to understand when, where and how the different dimensions of precarious employment developed across Europe. Additionally, this enables us to interpret differences in trends of precarious employment in relation to the country-specific institutional context. Therefore, this paper integrates these three aspects and describes the development of six dimensions of precarious employment (low wages, temporariness, disempowerment, unfavourable working time arrangements, lack of training, and lack of rights) across Europe. Using a hierarchical cluster analysis, we identify different trends in indicators of precarious employment. Preliminary results show we cannot identify a general trend of precarisation across dimensions of precarious employment, rather, trends vary depending on the dimension and country cluster. The results help us to assess when, where and how precarisation occurs in Europe, and can inform European-level and national-level policy about the most critical trends and their time- and institutional contexts, allowing for targeted interventions.","About 15% of Dutch employees works on a fixed-term contract (FTC). We aim to study how (changing) labour market institutions, in particular employment protection legislation, affect the likelihood of upward mobility for these employees. The Netherlands is an interesting case, since institutional change occurred in July 2015 when the Wet Werk en Zekerheid was implemented, and because employers and employees can deviate from the law in collective bargaining agreements (CBAs).  \n Previous research has shown that in dualized labour markets, i.e. labour markets with few restrictions on the use of FTCs and strict protection of permanent contracts, upward mobility is less likely. The 2015 legislative change aimed to reduce dualization on the Dutch labour market and thereby to stimulate upward mobility among employees on FTCs.\n We studied employment quality, i.e. contract type and income, of employees who entered the labour market on a FTC in 2009 and compared it to employees who entered in 2015. We use monthly register data and mixture hidden Markov models to identify employment quality states and to study how employees move between these states in a period of 48 months. We analyzed differences between the 2009 and 2015 cohort as well as the extent to which CBAs influence movement between states.\n We identified six employment trajectories that represented different patterns of movement between the eight states of employment quality we identified. The 2009 cohort was overrepresented in trajectories ending in inactivity and the 2015 cohort in the trajectory that represented a stepping-stone scenario.","This paper examines school-to-work transitions and early career differences in the Netherlands and Italy, focusing on gender and educational differences. Rather than examining isolated transitions between employment states, we use 5-year trajectories to identify differences in the likelihood of experiencing stable and protected early careers. While both countries have high rates of temporary employment among young people, Italy's high youth unemployment rates and difficult school-to-work transitions contrast with the more favorable context in the Netherlands. We use register data from Statistics Netherlands, which provides detailed information on employment, contract type, and earnings, as well as a unique dataset from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). This dataset combines administrative records on employment and income with survey data, providing insights into the socio-demographic characteristics of individuals. Using a Mixture Hidden Markov Model, we estimate error-corrected early career trajectories characterized by different degrees of employment stability. By treating \"employment quality\" as a latent variable, we simultaneously examine changes in employment status, contract type, and earnings, providing a comprehensive view of differences in early career trajectories as opposed to focusing solely on the transition from temporary to permanent employment. Finally, we examine whether less educated youth and women are more likely to experience trajectories characterized by instability and weak labor market attachment.","Due to weakly enforced regulations on statutory minimum wages and income protections for domestic workers, households play a decisive role in setting domestic workers’ wages. The absence of clear and enforceable wage-standards is frequently forwarded as an explanation for why domestic workers’ wages tend to be lower and less secure than those of workers in other occupational fields. In this paper, we aim to explain wage differences within the sector for domestic work, as the lack of wage-standards may also give rise to considerable variation in the wages paid by different households. Specifically, we hypothesize on the extent to which the height and security of wages are dependent on characteristics of households (such as economic resources and time pressures), domestic workers (such as ethnicity and age) and qualities of the relationship between the two (such as years of service and frequency of contact). Our analyses draw on primary data from 2023 on households from the Dutch LISS panel that hire a domestic worker (N=422). We operationalize the height of payments as the price paid for one hour of cleaning. The security of payments is measured by asking households if they continue payments when cleaning appointments are cancelled due to illness or holidays. In addition to descriptive analyses, OLS and logistic regression techniques are used to test the hypotheses regarding the height and security of domestic workers’ wages. The paper concludes with policy implications.","Unemployment insurance, disability insurance and social assistance, are benefit schemes that are vital in individuals' transitions from and to employment. While the majority of all recipients are on benefits only for a short time, the majority at any given time consist of long-term or recurring recipients. The causes of structural benefit recipiency are however poorly understood. One potential mechanism is a negative feedback loop of social capital and benefit recipiency. Many studies have explored the impact of social capital on employment. Furthermore, research on unemployment scarring indicates the existence of a negative effect of benefit recipiency on social capital. Following these two schools of thought, we expect a reciprocal relationship between social capital and benefit recipiency.\n \n Examining a sample of 3,774 individuals and 21,234 person-year observations between 2007 and 2019 from linked survey (LISS panel) and Dutch register data, we employ random-intercept cross-lagged panel models in a structural equation modelling framework to investigate the reciprocal relationship of social capital and benefit recipiency. These data allow us to identify short benefit recipiency spells, which are often missed in similar research, consider individuals' history of benefit recipiency before our observation window and examine non-claimants, i.e. individuals that are eligible for social assistance but do not receive any benefits. Preliminary results indicate that benefit recipiency lowers social capital but that social capital does not affect benefit recipiency. These findings could have important implications for our theoretical understanding of the relationship between social capital and benefit recipiency.\n","Previous research demonstrates that the education people obtain influences their entire working trajectories. One crucial characteristic of education here is specificity – the amount of general or job-specific skills that students obtain. While educational specificity has been shown to give a relative advantage in the early career (earnings and employment), in the later career, this advantage turns into a disadvantage. This pattern is also called the late-career penalty. To date, we still know little about why the late-career penalty exists. While previous research has mainly focused on the side of the employee, in this paper, we turn to the side of the employer, asking: How do hiring agents evaluate general and specific degrees in the early and late career? We thus want to understand whether and how employers take a part in influencing the trajectories of general and specific graduates. \n \n To address this question, we conduct a factorial survey experiment with people who hire for jobs in Software Development and HRM in Germany and England. This means that we look at countries with contrasting education systems and labour market structures and at professions that differ in how they are subjected to technological change. The survey experiment will allow us to disentangle how the different degrees are evaluated in the early and late career, how the level of education, participation in training, career mobility, and the applicants’ gender matter in these evaluations, and how these evaluations are grounded in institutions.","Despite long-term trends towards desegregation of the labour market, police organizations remain male-dominated, only due to lower recruitment, but also due to higher attrition of women. This is problematic, considering that attrition is costly and that higher representation of women is associated with better policing outcomes and police legitimacy. Attrition of women in policing is often attributed to the gendered nature of police organizations and remaining societal gender inequalities. However, these effects are often not explicitly studied, and even in settings known for their relatively high gender equality, such as Norway, attrition is higher. Using monthly employment register data of the full working population of the Netherlands, this study aims to compare attrition rates of Dutch female police officers to those of their male counterparts and their female peers in other (male-dominated) organizations. The latter enables us to not only describe gender differences, but also to study to what extent these are unique to policing, or rather reflect masculine-organizational or societal factors, as have been described in general literature on gender in organizations. Using this unique approach, this study hopes to inform efforts to retain more women in policing, both in the Netherlands, as well as in other countries. At the Dag van de Sociologie, we will present preliminary results of this study.","In recent decades, retirement has undergone a significant transformation, with an increasing number of people engaging in bridge employment, a phenomenon where retirees keep working while receiving pension income. Despite growing interest in understanding the determinants of bridge employment, existing research has focused on factors at a single time point close to retirement in single-country contexts. Therefore, it has remained unclear how barriers and facilitators to bridge employment are shaped across the life course in different countries. To address these gaps, we pose two research questions: (1) to what extent do financial resources and health mediate the relationship between work-family trajectories and bridge employment? and (2) to what extent does the relationship between these mediators and bridge employment depend on the generosity of a country's pension and healthcare system? To answer these questions, we integrate insights from cumulative (dis)advantage theory and welfare state theory. Using individual-level data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe and country-level data from Eurostat, we employ multilevel analysis within the structural equation modeling framework, enabling us to dissect direct, indirect, and conditional indirect pathways from work-family trajectories to bridge employment across 26 countries. Preliminary findings indicate that compared to full-time working partnered parents, those who were mostly divorced, part-time employed, and self-employed over the life course are more likely to work in retirement, whereas those being single, childless, and non-employed are less likely to do so. Further analyses will be performed to decompose direct, indirect, and conditional indirect effects in these relationships."]},"columns":[{"id":".details","name":"","type":null,"sortable":false,"resizable":false,"filterable":false,"searchable":false,"width":45,"align":"center","details":["Samenvatting: Prosocial behaviours are more commonly found among the higher educated. We examined to what extent genetic effects on prosocial behaviour captured by polygenic scores for years of education and cognitive performance can be detected. We apply a combination of an extended family approach using sibling fixed effects with polygenic scores to participants and their siblings in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS). Those with a higher genetic propensity to spend more years in education were more likely to have engaged in forms of formal prosocial behaviours, i.e., blood donation, charitable giving and volunteer work. The polygenic score explained ~1% of the variance. We found no clear association between the polygenic score for years of education and informal helping. Shared environmental influences among siblings are responsible for about one quarter of the association between educational attainment and formal prosocial behaviour, and about half of the association between cognitive performance and formal prosocial behaviour.","Samenvatting: Niet alleen overheden hebben bureaucratieën; ze zijn er ook in het onderwijs, de jeugdzorg, de gezondheidszorg, facilitaire bedrijven, de bouw en zelfs de sportvereniging en het zangkoor. Deze bureaucratieën zorgen regelmatig voor bureacratische overlast voor doelgroepen. Recente grote operaties 'tegen bureaucratie', zoals in de jeugdzorg en het onderwijs, leverden weinig op voor deze doelgroepen. Dat kwam mede door vage doelen, vage begrippen en gebrek aan effectonderzoek. Dat maakt de volgende vragen relevant:\n \n (1) Wat is bureaucratische overlast en hoe is hij te meten?\n (2) Wanneer en hoe zorgt een bureaucratie voor overlast en bij welke doelgroepen?\n (3) Waarom en wanneer zorgen bureaucratieën voor overlast?\n (4) Waarom en wanneer mislukt de aanpak van overlast en hoe kan hij wel effectief worden aangepakt?\n \n De Nederlandse sociologie heeft op dit terrein te lang stil gestaan. Dit paper geeft daarom een aanzet voor theorie en onderzoek. De uitgangspunten zijn:\n (a) Een bureaucratie is geen hiërarchische organisatie (zoals Weber suggereerde), maar een losvast netwerk van afdelingen en organisaties dat gezamenlijk consistente regelingen moet produceren.\n (b) Grootschalige bureacratische productie zorgt voor bijproducten: standaardisering, procedures en storingen.\n (c) De kwaliteit van een bureaucratie voor een doelgroep is het netto effect van zijn producten en bijproducten op de handelingsruimte van doelgroepen. Bij bureaucratische overlast is dat effect negatief.\n (d) Veel vormen van aanpak zijn voorspelbaar ineffectief. Doelgroepen kunnen bureaucratische kwaliteit wel verbeteren, maar alleen via eigenaren of eigendom.\n \n Dit paper geeft drie voorbeelden van de analyse van overlast en directe oorzaken: bureaucratische drempels (sushi), verwijsregelingen (dyslexie) en financiële regelingen (Toeslagenaffaire).","Samenvatting: Inspired by the literature on ‘diploma democracies’, indicating that the overrepresentation of higher socioeconomic status (SES) politicians reduces lower SES citizens’ political trust and voter turn-out, we study the effect of civil servants’ SES background on how citizens relate to both civil servants and local governments. Given that today’s bureaucratic organizations are dominated by higher SES professionals, we use a pre-registered population-based vignette survey experiment to test whether (in)congruence between civil servants’ and citizens’ SES affects how citizens relate to civil servants and local governments. We expect that when there is a congruence between civil servants’ and citizens’ SES, citizens a) perceive more cultural proximity between themselves and civil servants, b) have more trust in civil servants and the local government, and c) are more willing to participate with civil servants and the local government. Our study therewith crucially advances our understanding of democratic (non-)participation, and provides a starting point for tackling the unwanted underrepresentation in all forms of participatory democracy of citizens with a lower SES.","Samenvatting: Recently, there is an increased awareness that participation in volunteering is a dynamic process. Volunteering needs to be understood as occurring as part of a lifelong process of decisions made among changing circumstances, and is therefore best understood longitudinally. While this emphasis has reached the volunteering field, volunteering for humanitarian organizations seems to be overlooked. This is remarkable, since these volunteers distinguish themselves as they do not volunteer within, or for the benefit of, the in-group, but to help out-groups in society. Therefore, our study elaborates on panel data in which volunteers for humanitarian organizations are tracked over a period of fifteen years. In doing so, we seek answers to two research questions: 1) how many people start, quit or continue volunteering for humanitarian organizations over a longer period of time? And 2) which life course transitions are associated with starting versus quitting volunteering for humanitarian organizations? In order to answer our questions, we took advantage of high-quality panel data derived from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS). We depart from a resource-based approach in which we unravel what forms of capital, i.e., life course transitions related to human capital, social capital and cultural capital, play a role in the likelihood to start or quit humanitarian volunteering. In doing so, we take a unique approach by examining the relationship between transitions within the life course of individuals and transitions in and out of humanitarian volunteering. Moreover, we advance on related studies with only a cross-sectional design.","Samenvatting: Since mid-twentieth century, rates of overweight and obesity have risen tremendously in children and adolescents. One group at risk for developing overweight or obesity includes children and adolescents in single-parent families. However, the increased risk of being overweight or obese for children and adolescents in single-parent families is much stronger in some European countries than in others. The aim of this study is to examine two potential explanations for these cross-national differences. On the individual level, we hypothesise that social support by family, friends, classmates, and teachers reduces the association between living with a single parent and the likelihood of being overweight or obese. On the national level, we hypothesise that high levels of national school-based health promotion reduces this association. For this study, we use survey data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) dataset on adolescents aged 11 to 15 from 44 countries and their family structure, body mass index (BMI), and perceived social support. We complement the HBSC dataset with WHO data on national-level school health programmes and policies. We conduct mixed multilevel logistic regressions with respondents clustered in countries and schools and being overweight or obese as a binary dependent variable. Our preliminary results confirm that living with a single parent increases the likelihood of being overweight or obese. We do not find evidence that social support reduces this association; results on the moderating effects of school-based health promotion are soon expected. \n \n Keywords: overweight, obesity, single-parent families, social support, school-based health promotion, survey data\n","Samenvatting: Er bestaat consensus dat bewegen en sporten (de ontwikkeling van) symptomen van een slechte mentale gezondheid kunnen tegengaan. Deze relatie wordt belangrijker nu er in de afgelopen jaren wereldwijd aandacht is voor de slechte status van de mentale gezondheid van jongvolwassenen, met de COVID-19-pandemie als hoogtepunt. De jongvolwassenheid, van 18 tot 34 jaar, wordt beschouwd als een statusovergang in de geïnstitutionaliseerde levensloop, waarbij verschillende rollen- en statusveranderingen betrokken zijn, geleid door leeftijdsgerelateerde informele en wettelijke normen. De stap van voltijdsonderwijs naar de arbeidsmarkt is van cruciaal belang in deze overgang. In het onderwijs ervaren jongvolwassenen vaak nieuwverworven autonomie en vrijheid. Jongvolwassenen die werkzaam zijn, hebben daarentegen meer financiële vrijheid maar zijn minder flexibel met hun tijd en ervaren vaker stress. Het starten met werken lijkt dan ook een overstap te veroorzaken van teamsport naar individuele sport, aangezien deze over het algemeen minder tijdsintensief en meer flexibel zijn. Om bestaand beleid rondom de verslechterende geestelijke gezondheid van jongvolwassenen optimaal te benutten, is het essentieel om de relatie tussen (typen) sportdeelname en geestelijke gezondheid gedurende de transitie van school naar werk te begrijpen. Wij onderzoeken daarom: In hoeverre wordt de relatie tussen de tijd die jongvolwassenen besteden aan sport en hun mentale gezondheid gemodereerd door het hebben gemaakt van de overgang van school naar werk? En hoe verschilt deze relatie tussen het besteden van tijd aan teamsport en aan individuele sport? Hiervoor maken we gebruik van informatie uit twintig edities van de cross-sectionele Nederlandse Gezondheidsenquête 2001-2022.","Samenvatting: Despite the association of certain attitudes and worldviews (e.g., religiosity, trust in authorities) with non-vaccination behavior, some individuals holding these attitudes still choose vaccination, and vice versa. This study aims to explore why individuals chose to get vaccinated against COVID-19, despite holding opposing attitudes and worldviews (i.e., positive deviants), or refrained from vaccination, when their attitudes aligned with vaccination (i.e., negative deviants). By examining these atypical individuals, we seek to identify new roads to develop interventions to improve vaccination uptake. We conducted semi-structured online interviews with 21 Dutch adults in 2022. Interviewees were recruited based on their answering patterns in a survey that was part of a larger project on understanding vaccine hesitancy in the Netherlands. Positive deviants got vaccinated because they perceived COVID-19 as a threat, wanted to protect others, or wanted to regain their freedom. Negative deviants did not get vaccinated because they did not perceive the vaccine as appropriate, the disease not as threat, for religious reasons, or did not trust the authorities. The most important factors that could improve vaccination uptake were related to characteristics of the vaccine, such as effectiveness and side-effects. This study demonstrates that traditional models (e.g., Health Belief Model) can be applied to explain deviant vaccination behavior. Furthermore, the findings suggest that vaccination uptake might be promoted by promoting the collective benefit and imposing restrictions on non-vaccinated individuals. As some individuals will remain resistant to vaccination, tailored interventions for vaccine-hesitant individuals may yield greater success rather than attempting to persuade strict opponents.","Samenvatting: This study explores the challenges faced by individuals with a migration background in Belgium's healthcare system, focusing on medical decision-making (MDM). We intend to examine two primary challenges: (1) preferences for information disclosure and (2) responsibility in MDM. In Belgian healthcare, the law and ethical codes mandate clear disclosure of diagnoses and prognoses, yet migrant patients from collectivistic cultures often prefer limited information or truth concealment, sometimes favoring family involvement over direct patient communication. Additionally, these populations may prefer family-centered decision-making, contrasting with the emphasis on patient autonomy in Belgian medical practice. Our research specifically investigated these aspects of MDM among the three largest migrant groups in Belgium—Maghreb, Turkey, and Sub-Saharan Africa—through three focus groups comprising patient representatives and healthcare workers with a migration background. The aim was to understand the unique preferences and challenges these groups face in MDM across various contexts, including critical versus chronic care, decisions with severe versus less severe consequences, and choices concerning physical versus mental health disorders. Preliminary findings indicate distinct preferences and challenges within these migrant groups, which vary significantly based on the nature of the medical situation. This study highlights the importance of culturally sensitive healthcare practices to accommodate the diverse needs of migrant populations in medical decision-making processes.","Samenvatting: Since overconsumption is a main cause of environmental degradation, it is crucial to understand consumption patterns in our society as a shift to a sustainable way of consumption can make a relevant difference. Despite ongoing interest in exploring background factors (such as socioeconomic status, SES, and normative influence) that influence consumption, several critical gaps persist in our understanding. First, while research on the effects of separate SES components on consumption is abundant, comparatively little is known about their interplay, that is, whether the effects of one SES component (e.g., income) on consumption are contingent upon other components (e.g., education). Second, most consumption research examines different consumption behaviours in isolation, which may lead to an inaccurate estimation of one’s environmental impacts as not all consumption behaviours are equally subjected to SES and normative influence. To address the research gaps, we will explore the effect of the interplay between income and education on a multiplicity of consumption concerning fashion, food, transport, water, and energy, as they are the primary sources of individual carbon contribution (Center for Sustainable Systems, 2023) and are likely to be differently related to SES and normative influence. Utilizing CBS microdata (Statistics Netherlands, 2015), we will run a latent class analysis to identify consumption profiles according to peoples’ expenditures. We will then explore whether the profiles can be characterized by people’s income and education level. Our study can offer nuanced insights into the consumption profiles in the Netherlands and the role of background factors in consumption more broadly.","Samenvatting: The question of whether individuals incorporate climate change considerations into their reproductive decisions has emerged as a significant area of inquiry. Research in this field predominantly follows two trajectories: exploring the influence of extreme weather events on fertility planning, and investigating the relationship between self-reported climate change concerns and (often concurrently stated) fertility intentions. This study advances the existing body of research by leveraging individual-level panel data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) conducted between 2009 and 2020. The UKHLS provides information on a nationally representative cohort of approximately 50,000 individuals in the UK. We focus on two primary predictors: belief in climate change and self-reported pro-environmental behaviours (reported in waves 1, 4, and 10). The outcomes are fertility intentions and preferences regarding the number of children (reported in waves 1, 5, and 10). We execute the analyses in consecutive steps, with the main aim of uncovering whether any potential cross-sectional associations are present when more robust approaches to modelling the theorized causal links are applied. All analyses are run separately for men and women and for parents and non-parents at first observation. Our preliminary findings suggest that while there are some cross-sectional associations, particularly with pro-environmental behaviors as predictors, these do not hold when adjusting for essential covariates or employing person-fixed effects models. We reflect on these findings by discussing the narratives that people might employ to make sense of their fertility preferences in a society where the transition to parenthood is still seen as a key milestone.","Samenvatting: Household behaviours play a pivotal role in shaping global greenhouse gas emissions, especially in industrialised countries. However, little research has yet investigated how the collective actions and consumption patterns of household members contribute to these emissions. One important factor is gender, as previous research showed large disparities in the carbon footprints of men and women. A few studies indicate that women living in single-person households tend to exhibit less carbon emissions than men, which is in line with the norms and values associated with gender (Druckman et al., 2012). In contrast, women living in multi-person households tend to exhibit more carbon emissions than men, which is in line with gendered differences in household and care work (Smetschka et al., 2019).\n However, little studies have yet investigated potential explanations for such complementary findings. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the carbon emissions of men and women by taking into account the complex interactions that shape carbon emissions of multi-person households differently than the emissions of single-person households. Specifically, we argue that the carbon gender gap in multi-person households originates from the way that carbon emissions were attributed to the different household members without recognising that many of the activities predominantly performed by women, benefit other household members as well. By disentangling action-based from benefit-based carbon emissions, we hope to provide a more realistic understanding of individual carbon emissions across genders in the Netherlands. This distinction sets the groundwork for subsequent research into the intra-household dynamics that underlie collective sustainable consumption practices.","Samenvatting: This presentation focuses on the analysis of the visual identity that Extinction Rebellion NL (XR) creates on Instagram. XR is a global environmental movement advocating for urgent action against climate change. Through a visual analysis of XR's visual content, this study reconstructs how visuals contribute to the movement's image and its mobilization strategy. XR's iconic symbol, the hourglass within a circle, serves as a starting point, embodying the urgency of time running out. The XR activists organize protests, where distinctive visual elements, such as vibrant colors, creative banners, and theatrical performances, play pivotal roles in capturing public attention and fostering a sense of collective identity. Additionally, the use of visual idioms of liminality, civil disobedience and hedonistic party culture form a subversive image that is visually striking and creates visuals that are effectively covered by a diversity of media outlets. By employing comparative visual analysis and drawing on sociological frameworks, this research contributes to our understanding of the symbiotic relationship between visual communication, activism, and the mobilization of public sentiment.","Samenvatting: For centuries, mankind has thrived on the use of fossil fuels (e.g., oil, coal, gas). However, the presence of a changing climate has compelled us to reassess our dependence on these finite resources. The looming and already existing threats of climate change in combination of finite resources necessitates a turn towards more renewable, or green, energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydroelectric). This has led governments and international cooperations to propose laws and regulations that either restrict and limit the use of fossil fuels or encourage the implementation of alternative energy sources. While these policies already had an impact in the use of fossil and renewable energy sources, it is less clear what public opinion perceives as the ideal ‘energy mix’ – is there massive support for renewable energy for the energy supply, or are people of the opinion that traditional nonrenewable sources should remain dominant? The aim of this paper is to explain what Dutch public opinion perceives as the ideal energy mix. Relying on Seemingly Unrelated Regression techniques on a unique wave of the LISS panel, we can disentangle traditional economic arguments and value based explanations in the explanation of why some put more emphasis on nonrenewable than on renewable energy sources.","Samenvatting: In my book, A Sociology of Humankind (2024), I synthesize different strands of conflict literature, using networks as a common denominator, resulting in a general computational model. Here, I apply it to the global climate problem. At the root of the problem, wealthy investors in fossil fuel industries constrain billions of people by deteriorating the natural environment. These constraints enter discourse in terms of controversial issues, and their controversialness increases with constraint. If controversialness remains below a critical threshold, which co-depends on the network topology, investors and other citizens can reach a working consensus and resolve their conflict of interest. If controversialness rises above the critical threshold, however, people radicalize to various degrees, ranging from Extinction Rebellion at one extreme to resisting elites and commoners with vested interests at the other extreme, resulting in a polarized society. Will disgruntled citizens act collectively?\n \n Standing in the way of collective protests and climate-saving interventions are (1) the loose connections between climate activists across the world, (2) the lack of norms, selective incentives, and other mechanisms to self-enforce collective actions, and (3) the global legitimacy of nationalism: one (e.g., poor) country does not have the right to interfere with another (e.g., rich) country's climate measures. Consequently, effective collective actions seem unlikely. Nonetheless, collective action is possible if people become sufficiently agitated, e.g., by heat, pollution, or propaganda. At a critical level of agitation, cooperation will break out, but it might be too little too late.","Samenvatting: Worldwide, we are already witnessing the catastrophic impacts of climate change. Floods are among the most common climate-related disasters, with a fairly recent and nearby example being the flood events in Belgium, Germany, and parts of the Netherlands in July 2021. Managing these risks is ever more necessary. However, flood risk management (FRM) is often understood as a technical challenge. This is problematic, because FRM inherently involves decisions about the distribution of resources and risks in floods, which can be unfair. People are disparately affected by floods due to their socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, impacting their capacity to prepare for, endure, and recover after floods. These differences need to be recognised in FRM to prevent disproportionate impacts on vulnerable communities. This paper therefore examines recognition of differences in the capacity of people to deal with floods in FRM in England (United Kingdom), Finland, Flanders (Belgium) and France. We analyse if, and how, capacity differences are recognised in FRM policy and practice and through decision-making procedures, drawing on examples from the implementation of five FRM strategies in each country (flood risk prevention, flood defence, flood risk mitigation, flood preparation and flood recovery). At present, discussions on recognition justice are scarce due to a dominance of engineering expertise. A knowledge gap remains on how to make FRM more inclusive and just, which can be solved by the input of sociological perspectives. The paper also highlights opportunity spaces to strengthen recognition justice in future FRM.","Samenvatting: Heartfelt discontent takes hold of the Dutch countryside, culminating in various protests over the last years, causing quite a rumble throughout various layers of Dutch society. To connect to the scholarly question of how to understand different forms of resistance to the ‘agricultural crisis’ and to inspire the increasingly urgent policy challenge to transform the food system in order to fight climate change and biodiversity loss, this paper delves into varying cultural repertoires – thereby going beyond the ‘peasant-entrepreneur dichotomy’ – and more explicitly acknowledges different expressions of farmer resistance. We do so by using representative Dutch data, collected in the summer of 2020, during ongoing Dutch farmers upheaval and demonstrations. We show how farmers’ protests can only partially be understood as a populist movement and confirm a growing differentiation of cultural repertoires in Dutch agriculture, in which work experience outside of agriculture by both men and women is a factor of importance. As such, the survey results suggest that Dutch farmer demonstrations conceal populist forces as well as concrete promises for a more sustainable agriculture.","Samenvatting: Currently, due to the environmental impacts of meat, a major challenge is a societal transition towards more plant-based consumption. While chefs’ innovative craftsmanship marks them as potential change agents in such a transition, their agency is limited due to the nature of the established practice of eating out and its diverse carriers, such as restaurant diners. This paper aims to understand the tensions between this practice and changing discourses on meat and plant-based consumption. Using Shove’s concept of ‘infusing’, the paper examines how such discourses infuse this meat-heavy practice and more specifically, how the intertwinement between discursive and routinized elements in practice either supports or hinders meat reduction. Drawing from 23 interviews with head chefs of French/Western restaurants in the Netherlands, preliminary findings reveal how discourse on plant-based consumption infuses the practice of eating out in several ways, such as through culinary giants going plant-based and coordination between head chefs and more plant-based-oriented apprentices. Regarding forms of resistance, serving and eating animal products in restaurants is normatively acceptable and expectable, as exemplified by the ongoing popularity of meat dishes and the fear of bankruptcy after cutting meat off the menu. Taken together, the embedment of ideas about meat and plant-based consumption into the practice of eating out both facilitates and complicates meat reduction in restaurants. This paper contributes to the literature on social practices in transition; it specifically delves deeper into the underexplored territory of the practice of eating out in the context of the animal/plant transition from chefs’ perspectives.","Samenvatting: People’s perceptions about others play an important role in social influence processes: If people misperceive others, these misperceptions might shape their own behaviors and attitudes. Recent research suggests that many people are unduly pessimistic about the pro-environmental engagement of other people and that the majority think that they are “greener than average”. Such misperceptions could inhibit pro-environmental change. This study examines whether people hold such misperceptions also about proximal referends, while previous studies focused on large, abstract reference groups. We report results of a network study in which friends nominated by ‘seed respondents’ (university students) were also invited to complete the questionnaire. Seed respondents as well as their friends provided information about themselves as well as their perceptions of each other. Results show that people tend to see themselves as greener than their friends.","Samenvatting: This study investigates the perceptions of sustainability policies among less-educated citizens in the Zuid-Holland region of the Netherlands. In this explorative qualitative research, I used in-depth focus-group interviews with 58 participants to explore sustainability-policy perceptions amongst less-educated citizens from a sociological perspective. With this study three distinct evaluations of sustainability policies were identified. With this research three different policy evaluations were identified. The first evaluation highlights the perception of unfairness in policy design. Sustainability-policies are evaluated as unfair because they disproportionately benefit financially powerful entities, while citizens with limited resources cannot fully participate in sustainable living due to inadequate subsidies. Secondly, sustainability-policies are evaluated as insensitive because the interviewees experience a cultural distance which fuels their perception of policymakers as insensitive to their lived-experiences. Lastly, sustainability policies are experienced as ineffective, focusing both on policy design and implementations due to a lack of sustainable mindset amongst citizens and inconsistent policy decisions as a consequence of the fragmented Dutch political landscape. I conclude this research paper with recommendations for future research and implications for impactful sustainability-policy design.","Samenvatting: In this study, we use the “losers and winners of globalization” thesis (Kriesi, 2008; Teney, et al, 2014) to explain opinions on environmental concern. We focus on both economic and cultural “losers”. First, economically marginalized groups might experience problems keeping up with the political and societal debate on acting against environmental changes. For example, while individuals of higher socioeconomic status are often willing to pay for green energy alternatives, lower socioeconomic status groups experience difficulty financing these often-pricey investments, making them feel less concerned about the environment.   Second, individuals with a weaker cultural position are often relegated to the margins of society because of their inability to keep up with developments in a highly globalized world. As there is a worldwide call for acting against changing climate, followed by international regulations to tackle these issues, the cultural “losers” may backlash against this.\n These two forms of misrecognition can be linked to feelings of resentment which are often part of nationalist rhetoric and, in the political arena, combined with an ‘anti-climate action’ stance. In our research we therefore try to disentangle the two perspectives of the economic and the cultural “losers” of globalization and link it to feelings of nationalism. Our main goal is to study the impact of the national context on these relationships and test if they are stronger in more globalized countries. To test our ideas, we employ multilevel analyses on data from ISSP 2020 (28 countries).","Samenvatting: Dit onderzoek onderzoekt de relatie tussen cultuureducatie en het welbevinden van jongeren met een migratieachtergrond in Vlaamse cultuurhistorische musea. Sinds de educational turn in de tweede helft van de 20e eeuw willen musea hun maatschappelijke rol meer concreet gaan invullen en ontpoppen zij zich in toenemende mate tot alternatieve leerplekken. Musea hebben echter moeite met het bereiken van adolescenten. De groeiende diversiteit, de steeds snellere generatiewissels en de invloed van nieuwe technologieën zorgen voor uitdagingen tussen jongeren en musea. De collecties waar musea over beschikken, dragen vaak een narratief uit waar jongeren met een superdiverse achtergrond zich niet in herkennen. Een beperkt herkenbare representatie in musea kan leiden tot verminderde interesse en betrokkenheid van deze jongeren, waardoor het waarborgen van hun welbevinden tijdens museumbezoeken cruciaal is. De studie onderzoekt hoe musea en scholen kunnen tegemoetkomen aan de cultuureducatieve behoeften van deze leerlingen. Via kwalitatief onderzoek en theoretische analyse, inclusief casusanalyses met jongeren tussen 14-18 jaar in het Museum Dr. Guislain, MSK en het Industriemuseum in Gent wordt aangetoond dat naast het gezin ook het onderwijssysteem een significante rol speelt bij het bevorderen van cultuurparticipatie. De analyse richt zich op de percepties van de jongeren met betrekking tot de toegankelijkheid van musea, ondersteund door Bourdieu's kapitaaltheorie. Verder roepen de bevindingen vragen op over de effectiviteit van bestaande educatieve benaderingen en benadrukken ze de behoefte aan een meer doordachte en afgestemde cultuureducatie. Concrete aanbevelingen benadrukken de noodzaak van een inclusieve aanpak door scholen en culturele instellingen om de culturele kloof te verkleinen.","Samenvatting: Although scholars such as Bourdieu and DiMaggio have theorized on the relationship between cultural capital and network diversity, there is limited empirical evidence to back these theories. Building on recent studies on the conversion value of cultural tastes (e.g. Lizardo), we advance these notions by theorizing on how various aspects of cultural capital relate to educational network diversity. That is, depending on one’s educational level, we hypothesize that different forms of cultural capital have a contrasting effect on educational network diversity. For instance, for higher educated people, we expect that particularly popular cultural capital increases educational network diversity, as this is at odds with the conventional cultural taste in this group. Conversely, we theorize that for lower educated people mainly highbrow cultural capital is positively related to educational network diversity. As previous studies have hardly studied explanatory mechanisms for these relationships, our second contribution is that we study whether educational belonging explains these relationships between cultural capital and educational network diversity. Lastly, we innovatively put forward that the relationship between cultural capital and educational belonging is moderated by educational mobility, i.e. it might be stronger for stable versus mobile individuals. Based on LISS-data (2023), we test our hypotheses with structural equation modelling, for which we will apply Multiple Group Modelling. With our prospective results, we explicitly address previously untested mechanisms to provide new insights into how (various aspects of) cultural capital, educational belonging and mobility shape network diversity for both higher and lower educated individuals.","Samenvatting: This study operates at the intersection of cultural sociology and consumer culture to investigate the mechanisms through which sneaker collectors in the Netherlands assign meaning to their collecting practices and how this process shapes and maintains their sense of self. Furthermore, the article sheds light on the changing dynamics of contemporary collecting, particularly in response to the perceived loss of enchantment resulting from the convenience offered by online marketplaces. By analysing 20 in-depth interviews, the study identifies five distinct typologies among sneaker collectors: expressionists, social collectors, art enthusiasts, completionists, and hunters. In relation to identity formation, expressionists and social collectors use sneaker collecting as a way to do identity work, either on an individual or collective level. Art enthusiasts, on the other hand, find meaning in the aesthetic judgment of the intrinsic qualities of the object. Finally, completionists and hunters demonstrate the most engagement with market dynamics, as their motivations are influenced by these market dynamics, and their strategies revolve around navigating the implications of the reseller market and online marketplaces. Artificial scarcity and exclusivity often enhance their collecting practices. However, they strategically employ self-imposed limitations to attain a sense of closure or engage in a more meaningful hunt, thereby reintroducing a sense of enchantment into their collecting practices. \n","Samenvatting: In this study we investigate how majorities’ perceptions of the prevalence of ethnic discrimination are associated with various forms of interethnic contact. We propose that interethnic contact provides majorities with information about the frequency of discrimination of ethnic minorities, which leads to thinking that ethnic discrimination is more prevalent. While the literature has pointed to interethnic contact as a promising pathway to understand when majorities acknowledge racial discrimination, empirical research on this association is scarce, provides mixed results and does not differentiate between different forms of contact. We provide a detailed picture of these different contact forms by distinguishing between interethnic friendships, positive interethnic contact at work or in the neighborhood. We simultaneously control for negative experienced interethnic contact. We further explore how these associations between interethnic contact and majorities’ perceptions is dependent on majorities’ general attitudes toward ethnic minorities. This enables us to distinguish the information from the affective component in the assumed relationship. We employ data from the SOCON 2022, a recent national survey from the Netherlands which provides plentiful data on interethnic contact. Preliminary results show that, against expectations, more interethnic contact is not significantly related to majorities thinking that ethnic discrimination is more prevalent in the Netherlands. A possible explanation is that ethnic inequalities and discrimination have to be discussed extensively for it to be associated with majorities’ perceptions of discrimination. We do find that majorities’ attitudes towards ethnic minorities are associated with their perceptions of the prevalence of ethnic discrimination.","Samenvatting: This paper investigates support with which diversity policies in hiring are met within organizations. Specifically, I study differences in support between employees who are targeted by diversity policies (in this case ethnic minorities and women) and employees who are not. Hiring policies are one powerful tool that organizations use to decrease discrimination and hire a diverse set of employees. Despite organizations’ increased attention to and implementation of diversity policies, discrimination in hiring is stable. May this be due to a lack of support for diversity policies among an organization’s employees? While the literature has engaged with policies that attempt to make hiring non-discriminatory, research that addresses support for diversity policies within organizations is limited. This is surprising, as the literature suggests that a diversity policy which is endorsed within organizations is more effective in increasing diversity. In this paper, I focus on the ‘target group’ hypothesis and explore whether support for diversity policies within organizations differs between target- and non-target groups. I investigate if differences in support are driven by distinct perceptions of deservingness - are the target groups perceived as discriminated against at the organization and hence deserving of diversity measures? Additionally, I explore resource threat of the non-targeted group and the target groups’ possible fear of ‘stigma of incompetence’.\n The research design employs a novel conjoint experiment from The Netherlands, that assesses employees’ (N=1200) support for introducing sets of new hiring policies at their organizations. Policies vary between identity-blind and identity-conscious measures and differ in formalization levels.","Samenvatting: The existence of ethnic discrimination in the hiring process has been repeatedly confirmed using field experiments that confront real employers with fictitious applicants. However, the conditions that exacerbate or alleviate hiring discrimination have received surprisingly little attention by researchers. We study one such condition that might affect ethnic discrimination in hiring: employers’ attitudes towards immigration and diversity. \n Using data from a nation-wide field experiment in Germany, we, first, confirm previous research on ethnic discrimination in hiring by showing a hiring gap of 7 percentage points between German and Turkish applicants. Second, we study the relationship between anti-immigrant attitudes of employers and ethnic discrimination. Given that it is difficult to obtain direct information on employers’ attitudes from field experimental data, we use three angles to approximate employer attitudes. First, we look at local election results as a proxy for anti-immigrant attitudes. Second, we determine firms’ commitment to diversity by evaluating texts from job advertisements. And, third, we apply a survey questionnaire to a subset of our field experiment sample that gives us the opportunity to study recruiter attitudes directly. \n","Samenvatting: Highly educated minority individuals perceive more ethnic discrimination than their less educated counterparts, a finding known as the “integration paradox”. Despite being well-established, research on the theoretical mechanisms underlying the integration paradox yields inconsistent results. In this paper, we build on one specific mechanism, relative deprivation, which concerns frustration and unfairness feelings triggered by the difference between expectations and disappointing outcomes. By examining trajectories of educational aspirations and disparities between desired and achieved education levels, we aim to establish a causal connection between education and the perception of ethnic discrimination. We argue that previous studies have overlooked the process of aspiration formation: aspirations at time t depend on previous (un)successful investments in education at time t-1. Uncovering the causal impact of relative deprivation on perceptions of discrimination thus makes it imperative to incorporate aspirational trajectories to mitigate reverse causality concerns. Our study distinguishes between first and second-generation immigrants, acknowledging their distinct ways of forming aspirations. Leveraging longitudinal data from Spain, the Longitudinal Study of the Children of Immigrants in Spain, we span an 8-year period across three waves, repeatedly collecting information about educational aspirations, attained education, and perceived discrimination. Using fixed-effects models, accounting for prior discrimination perceptions and aspirations, we test whether and how blocked aspirations translate into perceptions of discrimination.","Samenvatting: “Even an extra five pounds can hurt your job chances”, as read in a heading of The Washington Post in 2016. Studies have illustrated that fat people face discrimination in employment settings, healthcare facilities, and educational institutions. Prejudice towards fat people plays a key part in these processes, yet little is known about its causes. Considering the vast amount of studies on various types of intergroup relations, it is surprising that research on prejudice towards fat people is relatively scarce and often primarily approached from a health or psychological perspective. Sociological research is however lacking. By exploring prejudice towards fat people among a representative sample in the Netherlands, this study builds on existing research that is mainly based on highly selective samples among student populations. This enables us to fill existing knowledge gaps on the omnipresence of prejudice towards fat people. Moreover, this study is the first to examine how educational attainment – one of the key predictors of intergroup attitudes – affects prejudice towards fat people. To assess how and when educational attainment plays a part, we explore how educational attainment intersects with contact with fat people and one’s perception of their own fatness.  We hypothesize that contact with fat people and self-identifying as fat hamper prejudice towards fat people and can decrease educational differences in this type of prejudice. We use data of the Social and Cultural Developments in the Netherlands survey (SOCON) 2020, which includes unique items of the existing fat phobia scale, to test our hypotheses.","Samenvatting: Information and communication technology (ICT) have become indispensable in contemporary schools in post-industrialized countries. Whether schools have succeeded on vesting students with the needed digital skills important in today’s highly digitalized societal landscape however remains unclear. In this paper, we examine whether school resources in terms of ICT infrastructure, use of ICT in education, and availability of technical expertise are pertinent to students’ digital skillfulness. We also investigate whether such school ICT resources are unequally distributed among students of different socioeconomic backgrounds, and whether students of different socioeconomic backgrounds unevenly benefit from these resources. In doing so, we illuminate school ICT resources’ role in the process of intergenerational transmission of inequalities. To test our expectations, we employ ICILS 2018 data on 14,183 students in 751 schools across seven OECD countries. Our findings, from multilevel SEM analyses, indicate that schools indeed play a meaningful role in nurturing digital skills, namely through students’ use of ICT in educational tasks. We also find that students from more advantageous socioeconomic backgrounds more often attend well ICT-resourced schools, pointing at the uneven distribution of school ICT resources in a way that reflects social reproduction. Alongside that, the availability of technical expertise in schools seems particularly fruitful for low-SES students’ digital skills development. This evinces that schools also compensate for limited ICT skills socialization in the family, pointing at social mobility processes. School ICT resources do nurture ICT skills but also concurrently augment and alleviate digital skills inequality.","Samenvatting: A lack of higher education institutions reachable from the parental home is associated with youth obtaining less educational qualifications and/or migration to places with a better offer of study programmes. In this case study, we focus on the Dutch province of Flevoland where two events – the opening of a train line and a sudden expansion course offerings – drastically expanded the number of study programmes reachable for local youth. We aim to provide causal evidence on how such an increase in reachable study programmes alters local youth’s study choices and internal migration. The offer of higher education programmes in Flevoland has historically been low, as there is no university and the universities of applied sciences only offered a small range of programmes. During our study period from 2005 to 2017, the local universities of applied sciences suddenly increased their course offering while the opening of a train line increased the reachability of study programmes within and outside the province. We use Dutch register data to track cohorts of graduates of secondary school in their decisions to enrol in higher education and to move to a different municipality. To estimate our effects, we use a difference-in-differences approach combined with matching to compare outcomes of local youth in Flevoland with youth in areas where the reachability of higher education remained low and stable over time. Our tentative results show that, against expectation, these events did not reduce migration to other municipalities, while showing small and inconsistent effects on educational choices.","Samenvatting: Evaluating policy programs in the educational field can be challenging due to the methodological issues and the complex structure of the educational landscape. This research uses CBS microdata to estimate the effectiveness of an extended school week intervention in Rotterdam South. The intervention is one of the main pillars of the National Program Rotterdam South (NPRZ) and aims to improve test scores and primary school advices in approximately 30 primary schools. We show how synthetic control methods can be applied to estimate the causal impact of the intervention in different schools. Synthetic control methods can estimate the effect of interventions that are implemented at an aggregate level affecting a small number of large units (including schools), on some aggregate outcome of interest (Abadie, 2021). We discuss the application of synthetic control methods in the educational field and possible advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we consider the implications of the results for the extended school week intervention.","Samenvatting: Reported trends show concerning developments in the health and academic performance of youth worldwide, as well as in the Netherlands. Whether these developments are related is uncertain, because we lack representative data that include information on both health and school performance in the Netherlands. The National Cohort Study on Education (NCO) has good data on all publicly funded schools in the Netherlands about school performance of pupils’ school trajectory and about their social background. These data are stored at Statistics Netherlands (CBS), and are available under strict conditions for researchers to perform scientific research. However, this dataset lacks information about relevant health aspects and behaviour. \n \n Therefore, we are collecting new data in the EPoSS project in 2024 of 4000 pupils in the Netherlands in primary and secondary education. This will provide a unique dataset of mental and physical health, health behaviour, as well as social environment and school experience. We will consequently link it to the individuals’ school performance and social background in the NCO data. This way, it will be possible to investigate the (predictive) links between social background, health, lifestyle and school performance. Consequently, the EPoSS dataset contributes to new, efficient research on children’s education and health in the Netherlands, and on the role of health in the social reproduction of inequalities in educational opportunity. In this paper, we present this new data source and inform the research community about the opportunities offered by the data.\n","Samenvatting: Ethnic, racial and religious minorities often experience discrimination in multiple life domains, which accumulates across the life course. Correspondence tests are a reliable way to measure the extent of discrimination, yet existing research in this area still primarily focuses on the labour market and typically does not take into consideration the cumulative nature of discrimination. In the current study, we therefore focus on discrimination towards Black, Muslim and Roma families in access to childcare in nine European countries, thereby also taking into consideration how (the absence of) success in the domains of housing and employment might spill over to childcare. In the study, we send over 10,000 emails to childcare providers across nine countries, in which we ask for a childcare spot and randomly vary the name of the fictitious sender as well as other relevant characteristics. Before running these field experiments, we test the perceptions of the names and pre-test the other experimental manipulations. The first results show that there is substantial variation in the extent to which names that are common among these minoritised groups are perceived as Muslim, Black and Roma, and that the novel experimental manipulations that signal success in other domains are noticed by readers. The actual field experimental data will be collected in March and April 2024.","Samenvatting: Experimental discrimination and bias studies, using correspondence tests, implicit association tests or vignette experiments, are increasingly aware of the signals, names contain. Previously, names were used as a proxy signal for ethnic origin, without thorough internal validation of those names. Although people infer ethnic origin from names, it has also been shown that signals of inter alia gender, age, religiosity, and socio-economic status are perceived. So far, studies analysing this focus either on the American context, or a specific European country. This study aims to compare the perceived signals in names over nine different European countries: Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Switzerland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. To do so, we analyse the perception of 1.008 names among a representative sample of 3.240 respondents. Hereby, signals of ethnic origin, gender, religiosity, and social class are considered, enabling us to indicate names with a strong internal validity for each country to be used in experimental research designs. ","Samenvatting: Conjoint analysis is a widely applied survey experimental technique to estimate the causal effect of multiple treatment variables simultaneously on an outcome variable. However, while conjoint experiments are ideal for studying respondents’ preferences, they do not give insights into the respondents’ information-seeking behavior leading to their final choices. In addition, although the conjoint design is believed to elicit lower social desirability bias (SDB) compared to other survey experimental techniques, little research studies SDB in conjoint designs. Building on work in marketing studies, we introduce a discrete choice experiment to the field of social sciences: the click-to-reveal (CTR) conjoint. The CTR conjoint allows respondents to reveal a limited number of conjoint attributes, but not all. By tracking which attributes respondents reveal, the CTR assesses the importance of information in making a choice. In addition, we expect SDB to be lower in the CTR conjoint because it captures stated preferences more indirectly, and because the choice is based on the subset of attributes that is selected by the respondent. We collected data from an online sample in the United Kingdom (Prolific, N=2200) and presented respondents with a scenario that is prone to SDB: a simulated hiring decision testing for ethnic discrimination. We benchmark the CTR against a regular conjoint and compare the importance weights and the parameter estimates of the attributes.","Samenvatting: Since the early 2000s correspondence studies have increasingly been used to study ethnic and racial discrimination. These types of studies are often considered the “gold standard” because they offer robust evidence of discrimination which does not suffer from social desirability bias. However, correspondence studies can differ greatly in how they operationalise the treatment and control groups, potentially driving differences in call back rates. In this study, we first discuss the concept and operationalisation of race and ethnicity in the context of correspondence studies, before exploring how existing studies have operationalised race and ethnicity and how this might have impacted the results. Using a dataset of 143 correspondence experiments, we collected data on researcher decisions such as: use of implicit cues such as foreign-sounding names, or explicitly stating ethnicity in the application, whether signals are placed in CV or personal letter, procedures for name choice and pretesting, and inclusion of connected signals such as religion or SES. The analysis consists of a descriptive overview of current practices and specification curve analysis of point estimates of callback gaps over signaling choices. ","Samenvatting: The majority of 2nd generation immigrants in Western Europe identify both with the ethnic group of their parents and the national majority group of the country they grew up in. Yet, many feel that they are not recognized as members of the national group and are instead misclassified as only ethnic minority members. According to the rejection-identification model, such feelings of identity denial can lead to a re-orientation toward the minority group and hostility toward the majority. \n \n Using unique social network data, we test for the first time whether perceived identity denial is the result of actual identity denial among peers. Students in vocational education in the Netherlands (N = 460) reported their ethnic/national self-identification and indicated to which ethnic or national groups they thought each of their classmates belonged. We explore to what extent 2nd generation immigrants who self-identify as belonging to the majority group are misclassified by their peers as ethnic minority members (misclassification indegree). Using multilevel structural equation models, we then test to what extent perceptions of identity denial mediate effects of actual identity denial on (1) perceptions of discrimination, (2) feelings toward the Netherlands, and (3) prejudice toward the Dutch. In the last step, we test whether friendships with majority peers (structural integration) moderate the effect of the misclassification indegree on perceived identity denial. This paper advances the field by comparing for the first time perceived to actual identity denial and by highlighting how structural integration can prevent negative consequences of identity denial.\n","Samenvatting: While a considerable body of literature has studied ethnic inequalities and discrimination in Latin America, just recently, there is a growing number of studies examining income inequalities by race, defined as a skin color gradation. Furthermore, most research equates ethnic self-identification with race, leading to confusion on the root of the discrimination. Only a few studies have addressed ethnicity and race as separate but intertwined characteristics to examine income disparities. This scarcity is particularly evident in the Latin American context, given the dominant role miscegenation played in the region and the heavy impact that it has had on the racial fluidity of its people. Hence, in this paper, I employ data from the Americas Barometer to investigate race and ethnicity income gaps in 17 Latin American countries. To do so, I applied non-linear regressions and decomposition methods, which allowed me to (i) separate the observable and non-observable factors of the income gap and (ii) decompose them by race and ethnicity and look at their intersection. In addition to the principal analyses, I conducted a series of robustness checks to evaluate the results' consistency and perform heterogeneity analysis to examine income inequalities per country. The analyses' results show substantial differences in the average income of the different ethnic and racial groups, mainly driven by differences in observable characteristics like years of education and employment status. In addition, the heterogeneity exercises indicate that ethnic and racial disparities vary across Latin America and can be explained partially by unobserved variables like discrimination. Overall, the results suggest that skin color and ethnic self-identification should be accounted for simultaneously when evaluating inequality.","Samenvatting: The migrants’ remittances to their country of origin have received ample academic attention. However, the remittances of refugees are relatively understudied. Given the increasing refugee inflow over the past years, and the importance of these remittances for the origin country, more scientific knowledge about the remittances of refugees is needed. This paper aims to test whether refugees are more or less likely to send remittances than other immigrant groups. On the one hand, refugees are more likely to remit to assist their families in need in their country of origin. On the other hand, given the precarious situation in the country of origin, they are less likely to return and thus more likely to invest in the destination country. Furthermore, given their fewer economic resources in the Netherlands, refugees are less likely to remit than other immigrants. To test these competing hypotheses, we will analyze large-scale survey data containing 4000 refugees and 3000 immigrants among ten origin groups. The richness of these data allows us to not only test the difference in remittances between refugees and immigrants but also the mediating role of return intentions, and economic- and sociocultural integration, using Structural Equation Modelling.","Samenvatting: Across Europe, an increasing group of retired migrants often spends their retirement in poverty. Individual immigrants have little influence on a country’s retirement institutions (pillar 1), and the pension they accrue via their employer (pillar 2) is largely driven by the disadvantaged positions that immigrants often have on the labor market (Drouhot & Nee, 2019; Heath, 2008). Therefore, I study the third pillar of retirement income: how often do different groups of migrants save for their retirement?\n A handful of studies shows that migrants generally save less than natives due to well-documented differences in their economic conditions (e.g., (Amuedo-Dorantes & Pozot, 2002). It remains unclear to what extent these findings also extend to retirement savings – given the lower pensions of migrants, their incentive to save is particularly strong here. I hypothesize:\n 1)\tMigrants save less often for retirement than natives\n 2)\tEuropean migrants save more often for retirement than non-European migrants\n 3)\tSecond-generation migrants save more than first-generation migrants, but less than natives\n 4)\tThe younger someone migrated, the more often they save for retirement\n \n I use multilevel data on 21 European countries from the European Social Survey, wave 3. Preliminary results show that saving behaviour of European migrants is comparable to non-migrants, and that non-European migrants save substantially less. This is true for the first as well as the second generation.\n \n","Samenvatting: Fertility below the replacement level is considered an urgent societal issue in large parts of the world, fueling policy makers' concerns about population aging, shrinking workforces and an increasing care burden. The decline to low fertility is particularly pronounced in East Asia, which has been explained by the conflict there between women’s high rate of educational attainment and labor force participation on the one hand and traditional attitudes towards women’s domestic roles on the other. This incompatibility of public and private roles is experienced especially strongly by people with egalitarian gender attitudes, who, as a result, are more likely to postpone or forgo births compared to people with traditional views, making gender attitudes a relevant factor in explaining fertility behavior. A particularly interesting context in this regard is China, which recently abandoned its one-child-policy, but has not witnessed pronounced increases in fertility rates since, thereby spurring scholarly interest in understanding the determinants of higher order births in the Chinese context. This study examines the transition to an additional child based on the gender attitudes of both partners in 2,708 Chinese couples using longitudinal data from the Chinese Family Panel Studies collected between 2014 and 2020. We use logistic regression models to predict the birth of an additional child by the gender attitudes of both partners and the dissimilarity between them as well as relevant control variables pertaining to socio-demographic status and factors of particular relevance to the Chinese context such as the sex of previous children and the Hukou.","Samenvatting: Contraceptive preferences are evolving in Belgium, with a noticeable increase in critical perspectives among women regarding modern contraceptive methods, such as hormone skepticism. Moreover, within heterosexual relationships, women are more aware of the greater burden of responsibility for contraception and managing its side effects. Consequently, there is a growing demand to explore avenues for equalizing contraceptive responsibility and developing more personalized contraceptive options for men. \n This study therefore aims to qualitatively research how both men and women in Belgium experience the process of choosing a contraception method, if this is accompanied by mental burden, and how more possibilities concerning male contraception would change this.  \n These topics will be discussed in 9-12 group conversations with sexually active adults without a current pregnancy desire., in every Belgian region (Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia). Additionally group interviews with people with a low socio-economical background will be organized if they are not represented in the general groups. The group interviews will be guided by a questionnaire focusing on peoples ‘lived experience’, and the interviews will be recorded, transcribed ad verbatim, and coded inductively and thematically. \n Having a better view not only on which contraceptive methods people prefer, but also why they do or do not want to use certain methods is valuable for both policy makers and health professionals involved in contraception counseling, family planning, etc. The results of this qualitative research could inform future contraception campaigns and provide guidance in contraception counselling and in developing more gender equal policies concerning contraception.\n","Samenvatting: It has frequently been assumed that relationships formed after prior union dissolution tend to be less stable than first-time relationships. However, the extent to which there might be a difference between the dissolution probability of first-time relationships and relationships after prior union dissolution likely depends on the criteria one uses to define a relationship. For example, does one only consider marriage, or any form of living together with a partner? Do both partners have a prior marriage/cohabitation relationship, or just one of them? Do both or just one of the two partners have children from a previous relationship, or neither?\n Using longitudinal register data from the Netherlands, we estimate the union dissolution probabilities for four relationship cohorts (2007-2010) over a ten-year timeframe using discrete-time logistic regression. \n Our findings suggest that, overall, relationships after prior union dissolution do bear a higher risk of dissolution than first-time unions – especially when both partners have children from a previous relationship – but that relationship definitions matter. For example, marriages tend to be the least stable when both partners were previously married, whereas cohabitation relationships were more stable when both partners previously cohabited. Socio-economic characteristics – such as age, income, or education levels of the partners – only account for a small part of these differences.\n","Samenvatting: During the last decades, care work of fathers has received an upsurge of scholarly attention within social and pedagogical sciences, especially because Dutch fathers and mothers aspire to more work-care equality. With the implementation of the EU Work-Life Balance directive the Dutch government has implemented more extensive legislation for paternity and parental leave to facilitate the process of a more equal care division. The premise is that policy measures influence care behaviour, and vice versa. We therefore expect to see a change in work-care behaviour between different generations of fathers. \n \tTo better understand this discrepancy between care behaviour on the one hand and care ambition and work-family policy on the other hand, this paper focuses on the question who adult sons see as ‘role models’ in their work-care attitudes and work-care behaviour.  Moreover, we looked at the intergenerational transmission of work-care attitudes and behaviours between fathers and their independently living adult sons in the Netherlands. We conducted paired-depth interviews with fathers and sons about how work-care ambitions and behaviour are passed down across generations, and how they are influenced by their environment. \n Based on a first round of analysis, our findings concur with previous research describing intergenerational role modelling as a selective, partial and uncertain (subconscious) process. Our preliminary findings suggest that fathers draw from a palette of ‘fragmented role models’ in order to construct their work-care behaviour in accordance with what is (or was) feasible for them and their environment at a given moment in time. \n","Samenvatting: This research delves into the experiences of children navigating the dissolution of stepfamilies, focusing on the impact on their mental health. Existing studies predominantly adopt a retrospective approach or explore long-term consequences, overlooking the critical period of the divorce itself. Acknowledging this gap, the study leverages data from Awel, an organization providing support to children and youth (6-25 years) facing various life challenges.\n In 2022 alone, Awel facilitated 22,165 interactions, with a notable portion related to familial struggles. This study employs a qualitative in-depth analysis of chats and emails between Awel and children specifically addressing the challenges arising from the dissolution of stepfamilies.\n Initial examination of the data reveals two distinct perspectives on the dissolution of stepfamilies. The first perspective centers on relief, where children express hope for the dissolution. For some, the separation brings relief, because they still harbor dreams of their parents reuniting, facilitated by the absence of parental relationships. These children seek support during their time within the stepfamily.\n The second perspective revolves around stress, capturing the experiences of children who successfully integrated into the stepfamily. For these individuals, the disruption of their established family life becomes a significant stressor. Awel receives most contacts from this group during the dissolution phase, as they seek guidance on navigating the aftermath of a second dissolution.\n This study aims to provide a nuanced understanding of children's perspectives during the dissolution of stepfamilies, shedding light on both the relieving and stressful aspects of this complex phenomenon.\n","Samenvatting: There is a remarkable rise in the visibility of transgender and gender-non-conforming individuals in the Netherlands. Current scientific research surrounding this topic often limits its own scope of analysis by prescribing a collective group identity to these individuals. Combining queer constructivism with feminist theories of embodiment, this qualitative semi-structured interview study aims to account for the distinct lived experiences of transgender and gender-non-conforming participants as embodied, self- constructed, and socially-constructed. Despite a few similarities, findings point to significant differences in the lived experiences of transgender and gender-non-conforming respondents.","Samenvatting: The recent literature on gender role attitudes (GRA) in western societies suggests that after achieving greater egalitarianism the upward increase in GRA has plateaued. However,  evidence of this plateau remains scarce globally, especially within Islamic societies. In this paper, we examine the nature and degree of change in GRA within Pakistan, a nation undergoing the two contrasting processes of modernization. On one hand educational expansion has consistently unfolded over past decades, while on the other hand the country has exposed to religious revival, particularly during the 1979-1988 Islamization period, making the direction of change unpredictable. A comparison is made across cohorts born from 1945-1994 using a pooled cross-section analysis of the World Value Survey (WVS), with Pakistan participating four times (1997-2018, N=5400). Drawing from modernization theory, we incorporate education and religiosity as mediating variables between birth cohort and GRA in our design, assuming cohort replacement predominantly influences the link between education, religiousness and GRA. Viewed across all birth cohorts we find that later born cohorts, on the whole, exhibit greater egalitarianism. However, contrary to the hypothesis of generational change, we find a trend reversal in GRA for cohorts born after 1975, who were more conservative. While education substantially mediates GRA, religion shows only a minor effect. Notably, the backlash in GRA cannot be explained by an increased religiousness induced by Pakistan’s Islamization since the early 1980’s.","Samenvatting: Despite developments in workplace equality, gender differences in career advancement persist to this day. While segregation within and across job types and gender role beliefs are established explanations of this inequality, social networks in and outside work play a crucial role as well. Through social networks, the resources of others can be mobilized and used for career advancement. This paper investigates the link between social support (career support and emotional support) provided by an individual's social network and individual career advancement. Prior research suggests, that men and women differ in their social networks, especially concerning network composition, but potentially also in terms of resource returns from their networks. For this reason, we investigate whether or not social support is equally beneficial for the career advancement of men and women, taking gender as a moderator into account. We use data from the SOEP 2019-2021 which provide information on support networks of individuals together with career advancement measured in the subsequent years. Given the nature of the network item, we aim to also investigate whether and to what extent the source of support (e.g., colleagues/supervisors) is of importance. The findings of this study hold implications for addressing gender-based career disparities.","Samenvatting: Research suggests that homemakers may have better mental health compared to employees, as juggling multiple social roles like work, caregiving, and parenting can lead to stress. Having one role less —the role of an employee—could potentially benefit mental health. The existing literature on the mental health implications of prolonged homemaking is scarce. An exception is the study by Langner (2022) that made a debut in taking the duration of homemaking into account. However, like most studies, they did not include men, despite more than 100 thousand stay-at-home parents in the Netherlands being male. We contribute to the literature by investigating the disparities in mental health between homemakers and working individuals, while considering gender and the duration of homemaking.\n \n We use unique longitudinal register data covering the entire Dutch population from 2005 to 2021 and fixed effects models to follow individuals’ (non-)employment trajectories and mental health. Institutions like the World Health Organization emphasize the importance of enhancing mental health. We extend prior research that primarily focused on happiness and life satisfaction, by employing more objective indicators such as mental health care service usage and prescribed antidepressants. Moreover, the rich register data allow us to consider homemakers within their broader context, incorporating characteristics of partners and potential children. \n \n Keywords: Dutch population data, gender, homemakers, life course perspective, mental health \n \n Langner, L.

Rwanda has employed efforts to bridge the gender gap in many aspects of life including education. Despite the efforts to bridge the gender gap in STEM fields, women remain underrepresented, particularly at higher levels of education and in STEM-related careers. Therefore, recognizing the complicated dynamics shaping female students’ engagement with STEM is essential for developing positive strategies to encourage their participation and engagement in these perceived male-dominated fields.\n Drawing upon an extensive review of existing literature and newly collected survey data from Rwanda, this study investigates how sociocultural factors, such as societal norms, gender stereotypes, family economic status, access to resources, career prospects, peer perceptions, and educational environments shape self-confidence, perceived gender stereotypes in STEM and STEM aspirations for 14 to 18-year-old female students.  Data were collected among a representative sample of 914  Schools in kayonza district, a disadvantaged district in Rwanda. Multiple regression analysis will be used to analyze the data and examine the relationship between social-cultural and economic factors and the dependent variables while controlling for other potential variables. \n The study findings are expected to inform educational policymakers, educational stakeholders, and parents for targeted interventions and support mechanisms to stimulate high school female students to aspire to learn and excel in STEM education therefore, contributing to the greater gender inclusion in STEM.\n Keywords: High school female students, social-cultural e","Samenvatting: In recent years, scholarship on arrival infrastructures has refocused attention to the importance of the local level as the main site where the social in- and exclusion of newcomers is negotiated. Compared to other newcomers, undocumented migrants face especially daunting legal obstacles in the process of contesting their exclusion and negotiating their inclusion. In this article, we rely on ethnographic research at the Pauluskerk in Rotterdam to argue that Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs) operate as migration infrastructures that facilitate this process locally for undocumented migrants. FBOs are uniquely placed to provide undocumented migrants access to resources because they have been historically constituted as spaces of sanctuary that test the limits of state sovereignty. On the one hand, we demonstrate that FBOs mediate access to material resources via participating in Bed, Bath and Bread programs and helping undocumented migrants to navigate the urban informal economy. On the other hand, we show that FBOs provide immaterial resources by connecting undocumented migrants to social networks, stimulating a sense of belonging and setting up bureaucratic firewalls. Extending the lessons learned from this case study, we argue that FBOs need to constantly navigate the symbolic space between formality and informality when engaging in infrastructuring activities towards undocumented migrants to stay true to their mission. At the same time, our findings indicate that the unique role that FBOs play as ‘safe havens’ in a hostile political environment can come under pressure as local governments increasingly seek to incorporate their efforts into local reception policies.","Samenvatting: In literature on political representation, citizens with a migration background are often studied as a homogeneous group, with ethnicity as their most important identity. However, previous studies have shown that there is diversity between and among minoritized citizens with a migration background in their experienced representation. We argue that intersections of several identities may be an important driver of experienced political inclusion and the differences among citizens herein. Furthermore, and equally important, we shift the attention to self-assessed identities. While previous quantitative studies have often scrutinized differences between citizens based on categorized identities under the assumption that these characteristics and their intersections are influential for their identities, we study the role that identification plays in explaining representation. For instance, the fact that someone is categorized as a woman with a migration background does not mean that their gender and migration background are salient for their identity, which may influence the way they perceive members of parliament with (un)shared identities and thus their experienced political representation.\n \n The current study delves into the role that identifications (e.g. identification with gender) play in experienced political representation. Applying an intersectional perspective to mechanisms stemming from literatures on social identities and political representation, we derive hypotheses on which ethnic minorities feel more represented politically and the role that identification plays. To test these hypotheses, we deploy unique data from the Dutch Ethnic Minority Election Study 2024 and combine regression analyses on individual experiences with political representation and qualitative analysis of open answers in the survey. \n","Samenvatting: This qualitative research delves into the intricate dynamics of Dutch recruitment practices and their impact on Eastern European labour migrants, shedding light on the interplay between these practices and the migrants' human agency. Following the European Union's expansion, the Netherlands has become an attractive destination for Eastern European labour migrants who often seek temporary employment in \"low-skilled\" positions through recruitment agencies. Previous studies consistently reveal the widespread precarity experienced by these migrants in various aspects of their lives and working conditions. The recruitment agencies they are associated with are often seen as exploitative, perpetuating a sense of victimhood among these labour migrants and denying them any human agency. Drawing on de Haas' agentic migration aspiration-capability framework, this study emphasizes the inherent ambiguity of recruitment practices throughout the entire migration process of Eastern Europeans. It explores how recruitment agencies facilitate the migration of these individuals by removing obstacles and providing essential resources, such as a package deal that includes work and housing, along with a crucial market position between workers and employers. Consequently, these agencies appear to monopolize Eastern European workers' access to the Dutch labour market. While this bundled package presents an opportunity for transformative changes in their lives, paradoxically, it also imposes limitations on the migrants' experiences throughout their migration process, creating a dependency on these services. This complex relationship between recruitment agencies and migrants showcases the dual nature of Eastern European migration experiences within the Dutch recruitment context.","Samenvatting: Tijdens de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van november 2023 bleek migratie het grootste verkiezingsthema, waarbij houdingen ten aanzien van immigranten sterk uiteenliepen onder Nederlandse burgers. Verschillende studies tonen aan dat het gevoerde politiek-juridische en sociaaleconomische integratiebeleid invloed kan hebben op hoe burgers de komst van immigranten ervaren. Tot op heden is echter minder bekend over de invloed van multicultureel beleid, en met name inburgeringsbeleid, op anti-immigranten houdingen. Dit terwijl de belangrijkste breuklijn in de Nederlandse samenleving van culturele aard is en anti-immigranten houdingen met name worden gevoed door zorgen over onverenigbare culturele verschillen met nieuwkomers. In dit artikel wordt onderzocht of veranderingen in het Nederlandse multiculturele beleid en inburgeringsbeleid tussen 2000 en 2020 invloed hebben gehad op veranderingen in anti-immigranten houdingen van Nederlandse burgers. Daarbij lijken twee mechanismes plausibel: de overheid kan met cultureel integratiebeleid normen omtrent etnische minderheden en culturele diversiteit overdragen op burgers (neo-institutional theory), of gevoelens van culturele dreiging oproepen (group conflict theory), die zij vervolgens meewegen in hun houdingen tegenover immigranten. Daarbij wordt beargumenteerd dat mogelijk beide mechanismes van toepassing zijn, weliswaar in mindere of meerdere mate voor groepen op basis van politiek vertrouwen en opleidingsniveau. De relatie tussen cultureel integratiebeleid en anti-immigranten houdingen, en de modererende werking van deze individuele predisposities, wordt getoetst middels multilevel modelling. Dit kwantitatieve longitudinale onderzoek maakt daarbij gebruik van zowel de Multiculturalism Policy Index en Nederlandse data uit de European Social Survey (rondes 1-10), als van een zelfontwikkelde index die inzicht geeft in veranderingen in het Nederlandse inburgeringsbeleid tussen 2000 en 2020.","Samenvatting: Against the backdrop of the political efforts to counter the systemic rural decline, European rural areas are becoming central sites of migrant settlement. Migrants are increasingly portrayed as ”self-sufficient tools” to revitalise communities and counteract rural shrinkage. While this involves increasing cultural diversity, rural areas’ traditional ethnic homogeneity and limited structural conditions may hinder migrant receptivity.  Connected to that, migrant settlement experiences may be hampered by the widespread anti-immigrant discourses which are especially salient in areas that have historically suffered political abandonment and resource deprivation. By comparing migrant settlement experiences in two distinct rural towns in Germany and Spain, this project explores the reception policies and the local reactions and welcoming capacities to migrant rural incorporation. It highlights how local reception and regeneration policies do not only sideline the role of newcomers as rural place-makers, who contribute to the sustainment (or expansion) of local services and infrastructures. They also result in conditions of “predatory inclusion,” in which migrants’ settlement is shaped regarding their potential “use” for (revitalizing) the local economy in exploitative terms and along racialised lines. In this context, local communities advance racialization, exclusion and Othering discourses. Facing precarious labour and housing conditions, migrants tend to reside only temporarily in the analysed areas. This study contributes to an expanding body of migration research in rural areas and problematizes the neoliberal push for rural regeneration through migration. It runs the risk of overlooking migrants’ needs and mobility projects, thus reinforcing the structural, racial, and class-based barriers present in rural areas.","Samenvatting: This paper proposes a comprehensive study of the labour market integration barriers and facilitators of highly skilled Latin American women in Flanders, particularly in Antwerp. It emphasises the complex effects of gender, familial roles, and migration status on immigrant women's employment prospects in Belgium, drawing on existing scholarly discourse. Underemployment or difficulty matching qualifications with jobs plagues highly skilled migrant women despite policy efforts. Due to their intersectional identities, highly skilled Latin American women in Antwerp's experiences are understudied. This study proposes semi-structured interviews to capture Latin American women's complex labour market experiences in Antwerp. A qualitative approach rooted in decolonial and anti-racist perspectives seeks to identify the barriers and mechanisms affecting their employment trajectories. The study examines how gender, ethnicity, and policy frameworks affect highly skilled Latin American women's labour market experiences to advance scholarship. It examines how ethno-racial disparities and gender dynamics affect employment outcomes through an intersectional lens. The research aims to inform policy changes and initiatives to better support the labour market integration of highly skilled Latin American women in Antwerp and Flanders by bridging recognition and redistribution dimensions.This research informs policymakers and stakeholders to enable more targeted interventions to address the unique needs and challenges of highly educated Latin American women in Flanders' labour market. The study aims to improve employment opportunities for immigrant women and enrich Belgian society.","Samenvatting: Skills in math and language are highly predictive for later outcomes in education and on the labor market. Early stimulation of these skills can have lasting effects. During the preschool period, parents play a crucial role in fostering their children's skill development as caregivers. These early investments come in various forms such as parents’ own math and language skills as indicators of the family’s human capital, parents’ education as indicator of the family’s cultural capital and other obtained skills in education, and household income as indicator of financial resources. As children enter school, their learning environment widens. The relative contribution of the parental resources might be different from the preschool years. Due to the lack of high-quality data on early school performance and subsequent learning growth, and comparable data on parental resources, empirical testing has been limited. Our study focuses on children's school performance in math and language at the start of primary education, as well as their learning growth during primary education, and examines how the three parental resources - parental math and language skills, education, and household income - influence these outcomes. We developed a dataset, combining longitudinal test information of Dutch children in primary education to school survey data and register information of their parents. Using latent growth models, our preliminary results show that early performance in language and math is mostly associated with parents’ skills, while parental education has a bigger influence on the subsequent learning growth in primary education. Household income has the least impact.","Samenvatting: Higher education is an industry known for its high prevalence of sexual harassment, even though few victims formally disclose their experience. Reasons for this underreporting include the inability to conceptualise one’s own experience as sexual harassment and fear that it will not be taken seriously by the institution. Following Fricker (2007), we believe both cases could be better understood by viewing it through the lens of hermeneutical injustice, which arises when someone is unable to make their own experience intelligible to themselves or others due to hermeneutical marginalisation and structural inequality. Hence, the main research questions of the current study are: (1) How does hermeneutical injustice play a role in university members’ decision to not report sexual harassment to institutional services?; (2) (How) does hermeneutical injustice occur after reporting sexual harassment to institutional services? \n To answer these research questions, the Belgian sample of the Uni4Equity questionnaire dataset on sexual harassment in higher education will be analysed (N = 1403 for staff and N = 1786 for students) and complemented by in-depth interviews with stakeholders who have been directly involved in sexual harassment cases at Antwerp University. Through the combined data, we wish to provide recommendations to higher education institutions on how to identify hermeneutical injustice during sexual harassment procedures, and to enable universities to limit the negative short- and long-term health and career consequences for victims.","Samenvatting: Education serves as both an enhancer of opportunities and a mechanism for the intergenerational reproduction of advantage. To understand which of these two faces of education takes the lead, sociologists studied skill acquisition during periods when children attend school, compared to periods when they do not, such as during the summer break. Such a seasonal comparison approach allows for the examination of exposure to schooling as a channel to raise academic achievement and potentially reduce inequalities by socioeconomic background. Recent doubts about the replicability of seasonal learning gap findings prompt a reevaluation of exposure effects. Therefore, we employ an elaborate differential exposure model to provide more precise and nuanced insights into the efficacy of education in advancing academic achievement and reducing socioeconomic inequalities. Leveraging data from the Netherlands Cohort Study on Education, including national achievement tests in reading and mathematics from Grades 1-5, our study investigates exposure effects by examining the length of intervals between midterm and end-of-term tests. Given that we have rich data over multiple school years, with two test moments per pupil per grade, we can use the different sources of variations to allow for stronger tests of causality of exposure.","Samenvatting: The taxation of wealth is a controversial topic in Belgium, particularly in the lead up to the 2024 elections. Taxes on labour in Belgium are relatively high compared to other OECD countries, while taxes on wealth are limited. In light of the growing gap between the few ‘haves’ and the many ‘have-nots’, international institutions such as the IMF, OECD, and the European Commission have recommended increasing taxes on wealth and reducing taxes on labour. Public support for taxes is an important issue, as there is substantial evidence that it strongly influences policy making. However, most empirical research has focused on attitudes toward income rather than wealth redistribution. As income and wealth are intuitively often considered two sides of the same coin, it is important to compare attitudes toward wealth and income taxes. This paper analyses public attitudes toward both income and wealth taxes in Belgium, as well as the determinants of these tax attitudes. It examines both structural variables, such as household income and subjective social class, and cultural variables, such as welfare state attitudes and individualism. The structural variables are based on the theories of rational choice and self-interest, while the cultural variables are based on theories of ideology, values, and beliefs.

Vanaf dat moment mochten aanbieders ook reclame maken voor online kansspelen, met als doel de huidige online kansspeldeelnemers van het illegale naar het gereguleerde legale aanbod te leiden. Voorafgaand aan de legalisering van online kansspelen hebben verschillende Eerste en Tweede Kamerleden hun zorgen geuit met betrekking tot het reclamebeleid. Reclames mogen namelijk niet gericht worden op kwetsbare groepen, waaronder jongeren tot 24 jaar. Het is nog onduidelijk in hoeverre het legaliseren van online kansspelen in Nederland leidt tot een toename van het aantal deelnemers. Om hier inzicht in te verkrijgen is er op basis van een secundaire dataset met 2906 respondenten, aan de hand van logistische regressieanalyses onderzocht hoe groot de kans is dat men gaat deelnemen aan online kansspelen naarmate men blootgesteld is aan kansspelreclames, en of de invloed van reclames groter was voor jongeren dan voor volwassenen. Deze twee analyses zijn ook uitgevoerd per type online kansspel op basis van een grotere steekproef met 4380 respondenten. De uitkomsten van het kwantitatieve onderzoek laten zien dat naarmate men meer blootgesteld is aan reclames voor kansspelen, men sneller geneigd is deel te nemen aan online kansspelen. De impact van reclame op deelname aan online kansspelen was het sterkst bij krasloten en het wedden op paardenraces. De invloed van reclame was echter niet groter voor jongeren ten opzichte van ouderen. Wel blijkt dat jongeren over het algemeen sneller geneigd zijn om deel te nemen aan online kansspelen. Op basis van dit onderzoek concluderen we dat de legalisering van online kansspelen in Nederland zal leiden tot een toename van het aantal online kansspeldeelnemers.","Samenvatting: Despite an abundance of studies on how citizens consider welfare deservingness, little is known about the meanings they attribute to these considerations. This is crucial, as these considerations may mean something wholly different for different groups. For example, some may perceive welfare deservingness primarily through the lens of economic considerations, while others may do so primarily through a cultural lens. Inspired by a recent stream of small-n qualitative studies that have explored deservingness considerations among citizens, this paper presents an innovative quantitative analysis of the different meanings citizens attribute to their evaluations of welfare deservingness. I do so by applying the method Correlational Class Analysis to an original survey fielded among a representative sample in the Netherlands (n = 2,131). As such, five meanings are uncovered where people have a unique understanding about welfare deservingness. The people who adhere to these different deservingness meanings differ substantively in terms of social bases, i.e., they differ when it comes to political preference, education, income, religious denomination, and media preference. These findings demonstrate that different groups have fundamentally different things in mind when they think about the welfare deservingness of others. I discuss the implications of these findings for the fields of social policy analysis and, more broadly, sociology and political science.","Samenvatting: As part of the Growing Up Together in Society (GUTS) consortium, this research aims to contribute to our understanding of how trust develops in adolescents, with special attention to the role of SES and ethnicity therein. Trust is defined as the willingness to be vulnerable to actions of others while expecting a future reciprocation that is not guaranteed. During adolescence, sociocognitive processes underlying trust such as social learning processes and perspective-taking develop. To determine adolescents’ trust behaviour to different targets, we will employ the modified economic Trust Game to determine adolescents’ trust behaviour towards (i) close (i.e. a parent or a caregiver), and two types of distant targets (i.e. (ii) parent/caregivers of an unknown peer; (iii) individual from contested institutions because of class and ethnic profiling, such as the police and child protection services). Approximately 300 adolescents aged 10 to 20 will be assessed both behaviourally and by functional MRI data acquisition. First, we expect adolescents’ level of trust in the close target to be higher than their trust in the distant targets. Second, because the institutional targets are associated with class and ethnic profiling, we hypothesize that target differentiation will be more pronounced among low-SES and non-white adolescents. Last, we anticipate neural activity in social brain regions, including the precuneus and temporal parietal junction, to reflect this target differentiation.","Samenvatting: We hypothesize that (fear of) violent victimization reduces levels of trust in commercial transactions. Social trust is the probability with which one expects others to perform in a particular way. It is expected to increase the propensity to collaborate or exchange, first and foremost, because it reduces the subjectively assessed risk and, thus, the cost of the interaction. It substitutes moreover transaction costs of control monitoring with a less costly alternative. This transactional trust is even more the oil lubricating trade in environments with weak formal institutions. At the same time, these fragile states often suffer from more violence.\n \n We hypothesize that both the fear of crime and the direct or peer-initiated experience of violent crime have a chilling effect on economic cooperation. The mechanism is provided by decreased social trust in transactions.\n \n The empirical estimation relies on survey data of the AFROBAROMETER (round 7), collected in 34 African countries among 46,000 respondents. They gauge the trustworthiness a buyer assesses in a seller of maize or rice. Different matching designs allow us to estimate the real effect of fear of crime and victimization on trust levels in sellers in a commercial market. The impact is assessed with an individual-level and a neighborhood-level estimate of fear of crime and victimization. Both indeed seem to affect trust in commercial transactions significantly.","Samenvatting: Social media has become a crucial tool for politicians seeking to connect with, particularly younger, voters. The landscape of online political communication is increasingly dominated by visuals and images. Despite this shift towards visual content, the significant role images and videos play in shaping online political discourse remains underexplored. This presentation delves into the visual narratives crafted by European far-right leaders in the content they share on TikTok and Instagram. Through a qualitative analysis, the visual elements, rhetoric, and symbolism embedded in the videos disseminated by these leaders are examined, providing insights into how these leaders exploit visual platforms to communicate ideologies, construct personas, and enhance community engagement with their followers. The study's findings are linked to the distinctive features of these two platforms, contributing to a better understanding of how far-right party leaders (strategically) present themselves online to mobilize support.","Samenvatting: Wetenschappelijk onderzoek laat een trendbreuk zien waarbij jongere generaties er conservatievere en autoritairdere waarden op nahouden dan hun voorgangers (Muis et al., 2019; Muis & Reeskens, 2022). In het publieke debat lijken deze bevindingen echter een nieuwe draai te hebben gekregen. Zo zouden alleen jongens conservatiever worden, terwijl meisjes zich juist steeds progressiever ontwikkelen (e.g., Burn-Murdoch, 2024; The Economist, 2024). Voor deze groeiende ‘ideologische genderkloof’ wordt echter weinig robuust bewijs geleverd: waarden worden gelijkgesteld aan attitudes en stemgedrag, en longitudinale en cross-sectionele perspectieven wisselen elkaar af. In het huidige onderzoek gaan wij na of er onder jongeren inderdaad een genderkloof bestaat die groter is dan onder voorgaande generaties. We richten ons hierbij specifiek op waarden, omdat deze in vergelijking met attitudes en gedrag fundamenteler van aard zijn (Halman & Sieben, 2020), en dus de kern zouden kunnen vormen van (toekomstige) maatschappelijke spanningen. Daarnaast weten we vanuit de gevestigde literatuur dat mannen en vrouwen er inderdaad andere waarden op nahouden, maar er bestaan diverse theorieën over of, hoe, en wanneer deze verschillen groter worden (e.g., Prince-Gibson & Schwartz, 1998; Rokeach, 1974; Norris & Inglehart, 2008). Door gebruik te maken Nederlandse data van de European Values Study (1981-2017) kunnen we de longitudinale trends goed in kaart brengen en focussen we ons op een land waarin genderverschillen aan sterke veranderingen onderhevig lijken (Inglehart & Norris, 2000).","Samenvatting: With the debate about multiculturalism being increasingly characterized by mutual radicalization, studies show that a substantial part of the majority population in Western European countries shares a concern about the effect of Islam on democratic values. To counter the bloating effect of these radical narratives, it becomes crucial to get an accurate picture of the actual level of support for liberal democratic principles among Muslim majorities. Moreover, this support should be compared to the majority population, as one can otherwise not make a suitable comparison. \n \n Yet, studies measuring public support of democratic principles, especially those researching minorities, tend to use limited measures. The assumption in these measures is that liberal democracy is a one-dimensional concept that citizens will either accept or reject in a consistent way. However, because of the inherently conflictual nature between different elements of liberal democracy, most importantly between majority rule and constitutional constraints, we argue that these approaches are unfit for capturing how individuals understand democracy. Rather than approaching liberal democratic support as a unidimensional concept, this paper will use a person-centered approach to provide a more nuanced picture of how people combine support for different democratic principles into a consistent belief system.\n \n Using the Belgian National Election Studies of 2019 for the majority population and the Belgian Minority Election Studies of 2019 for the minority population, this study will make use of Multiple-Group Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to distinguish different democratic profiles within both the majority and Muslim minority populations in Belgium. \n","Samenvatting: Sustainability scientists need and want sociological theory and insights to help provide theoretical grounding for societal change processes towards a more sustainable future.

Door etnografie te combineren met vrijwilligerswerk in een speeltuin, een buurtrestaurant en een buurttuin, ga ik in op hoe betrokkenheid bij deze plekken bepaalde slepende spanningen voelbaar maakt: de geracialiseerde, geclassificeerde en gegenderde kwaliteiten van het maken van relaties, vertrouwen en wantrouwen in wetenschap en overheid en conflicten zonder resolutie. Door middel van deze vignetten zal ik Sandra Harding’s vraag \"Whose science? Whose Knowledge?\" herarticuleren: wie heeft er baat bij wetenschappelijke kennis en wiens stem is er betrokken bij de totstandkoming ervan?","Samenvatting: In deze bijdrage reflecteren we op het veldwerk van ons lopende onderzoek naar openbare bibliotheken als sociale infrastructuren (‘Infrastructuring Libraries in Transformation’ - ILIT). Een van onze drie onderzoeksthema’s is ‘community librarianship’, bestaande uit participerende observatie in twee bibliotheken en een zine-making workshop met bibliotheekmedewerkers. Als participerende observant liepen we mee met bibliotheekmedewerkers om zo hun dagelijkse werkzaamheden in kaart te brengen en tot op enige hoogte te beleven. Tijdens de zine-making workshop gingen we met medewerkers in gesprek om zowel het gemeenschapsgevoel in en door openbare bibliotheken te bestuderen én te ontwikkelen. Zine-making is zowel een product als een proces dat het mogelijk maakt om verder te gaan dan verbale communicatie en om gelijkheid, sociale rechtvaardigheid en sociale verandering te bevorderen. Binnen etnografisch en participatie onderzoek wordt de onderzoeker verwacht reflexief te zijn. Ook daagt co-productief zine-making de traditionele machtsdynamiek van kennisproductie in de academische wereld uit, waarbij deelnemers de data ontwikkelen en de onderzoeker als facilitator aanwezig is. In onze bijdrage reflecteren we op  hoe we onderzoek doen en stellen we vragen als “hoe gaan we om met feedback van deelnemers?” en “hoe nemen we afscheid wanneer we ‘het veld’ verlaten?”","Samenvatting: Veel onderzoek naar sociale infrastructuur behandelt plekken, organisaties, en evenementen die al als sociale infrastructuur functioneren. Hierdoor blijft het moeilijk om te bestuderen hoe sociale infrastructuur gecreëerd kan worden. Bij het Michi Noeki project in Groningen zijn we sinds een vroeg stadium betrokken waardoor we de intenties, processen, en uitkomsten van de implementatie van het project kunnen onderzoeken. Het doel van de Michi Noeki’s is een netwerk van ‘halteplaatsen’ waar men even kan zitten, naar de wc kan, goedkope koffie aanwezig is, en waar de telefoon of scootmobiel opgeladen kan worden. Uiteindelijk moet dit bijdragen aan het vergroten van de mobiliteit van ouderen, het terugdringen van eenzaamheid, en het bevorderen van participatie. In deze bijdrage reflecteer ik op de voor- en nadelen van deze vroege betrokkenheid en de gevolgen voor onderzoeksplanning, relaties tussen actoren, en werving en vertrouwen van uiteindelijke gebruikers en vrijwilligers.","Samenvatting: The debate around sex work policy is often characterised by an apparent dichotomy when it comes to the legislative approach to be taken: some form of prohibition or decriminalisation. These oppositional viewpoints have led to what some call the 'prostitution wars'. Given these polarised viewpoints, a thorough investigation of the merits and faults of each policy approach is warranted. We conduct a systematic review using the PRISMA framework. This review allows us to check whether the effects of different policies, regulations, and enforcement types on diverse outcomes have been well documented. Outcomes range from sex workers' health and safety to possible externalities that spill over to the larger community.\n Overall, the most important conclusion of the review is that the quantity of research published is profuse. At the same time, the review indicates that rigid, well-informed and well-designed studies are called for. The hot debate has not given rise to many reliable studies. Notwithstanding the abundance of publications, well-designed empirical research is in short supply. The gap may be due to data scarcity and a skills mismatch between needs and researchers' profiles. \n Findings indicate that criminalisation, also in the case of the so-called Nordic model criminalising clients only,  sex worker displacement is apparent. This displacement mostly seems to increase occupational risks for them. Most studies indicate that the health outcomes are pretty adverse for sex workers. Potentially, the harm also spills over to wider society, for instance, through STIs. Decriminalisation increases supply but concurrently reduces relative risk-taking and adverse outcomes.","Samenvatting: Female genital cutting (FGC) refers to various practices involving the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons. In Kenya, where the current study is situated, the practice is increasingly being medicalized, meaning that FGC is more and more performed by medical health professionals rather than traditional practitioners. However, performing FGC is prohibited by law in Kenya, regardless of who conducts it. Research informing FGC abandonment strategies often focuses on coordinating change in norms and behavior among people interacting with one another, starting by identifying key actors in the decision-making process concerning FGC. However, how this information unfolds within the newly emerging evolution toward the medicalization of the practice has not yet been identified. The current research entangles how the trend towards medicalization influences the decision-making process concerning a girl’s cut, by looking at how the decision is made, who influences it, and how this differs between people born in different birth cohorts. We conducted 60 in-depth interviews with mothers with at least one living daughter within the Maasai ethnic group, located in Narok County, and among the Abagusii ethnic group in Kisii County. Preliminary results show several important findings contributing to a better understanding of FGC medicalization and its evolutions. We found crucial insights into the agency for Maasai young women concerning medical decision-making, the normative framework surrounding medicalization among Abagusii mothers, and how its evolutions, underlying reasons for medicalization, and key actors in the decision-making differ between these ethnic groups.","Samenvatting: This study explores the trajectories of women presenting for abortion in Flanders, Belgium. It has two primary objectives. First, it maps the various stages of the abortion trajectory for women presenting for abortion. Second, barriers that cause delays within these stages are identified. Data were used from the ATTAS project, which collected data among all women seeking abortion care at one of the Flemish abortion centers; specifically, the LUNA centers. Preliminary results show that a considerable number of women experience difficulties suspecting an unplanned pregnancy. This can be due to various reasons such as not immediately linking the symptoms to a possible pregnancy, mistakenly believing it is hard or impossible to get pregnant in their particular situation. Additionally, over one-third of women who completed the questionnaire up to now first had a consultation with a GP before they contacted the abortion center, which lengthens and in some cases complicates the trajectory. We also found that around 40% of the respondents indicated feeling ashamed or disappointed in themselves when deciding about the pregnancy. However, 94% indicated that their decision was set at the time they completed the questionnaire. Around 46% experienced fear of the procedure and associated pain. Furthermore, qualitative data are currently being collected to gain an in-depth understanding of abortion trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first study within the Flemish context to investigate abortion timing, access, and trajectories. Furthermore, this study is highly topical given the ongoing public and political debates on Belgian abortion legislation.","Samenvatting: In this paper, we analyze the relationship between development and outgoing international student mobility (ISM) for the years 2003–2018 using data from UNESCO. Starting from migration transition theory, we expect that development and outgoing migration follows an inverted U-shape due to changes in capabilities and aspirations of populations. As predicted, we find that outgoing ISM also follows this pattern. Probing deeper into this finding, we investigated whether students from countries of different levels of development favor different destination countries, focusing on destination countries’ academic ranking, GDP per capita, and linguistic and colonial ties. We find that these destination country characteristics indeed have different effects for students from origin countries with different stages of development, and that these effects cannot simply be reduced to a dichotomy between developed/developing countries. Together, the findings highlight the nonlinearity of ISM processes. In turn this opens up new avenues of research regarding the diversity of international student populations.","Samenvatting: For a long time, internationalisation strategies of higher education institutions across the world focused on international student mobility. However, international student mobility is a socially selective process, whereby students from lower socio-economic backgrounds are less likely to participate. Consequently, in recent years ‘internationalisation for all’, ‘inclusive internationalisation’ and ‘internationalisation at home’ have become prominent terms in internationalisation strategies, aiming to provide internationalisation activities to all students, including those who remain at home. However, recent scholarship indicated students from lower socio-economic backgrounds are less likely to participate in any internationalisation activity compared to students from higher socio-economic background. In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms behind such selectivity patterns, based on an analysis of 28 in-depth interviews conducted with students from different social backgrounds as well as 3 focus groups with educational program directors at a Dutch higher education institution.","Samenvatting: The analyses of the trends and flows in International Student Mobility (ISM) overlooks different trajectories, geographies, and rationales of the phenomenon. The tendency to conceptualize ISM as an involvement of the global elite shades the movements of the students with mobility capital shortage. Several studies documented that a lack of academic, economic, social, and mobility capital restrains the direct movement of International Students (IS) to a target country. This evokes a stepwise migration by stationing in an intermediary country to complete part of the higher education study and move forward to targeted destinations later, preferably after completing their study in the station country. There is very limited research on the role of academic, social, and economic experiences of the IS in their stepwise migration intentions. Drawing and theorizing on the stepwise migration theory this study investigates the factors playing role in the onward mobility intentions of IS in Turkey. First, a quantitative study for predicting the role of academic, social, and economic variables in onward mobility intentions was conducted with 1752 international students in Turkey originating from the Middle East, Africa, Central Asia, and South East Asia. Next, interviews with 27 students were conducted to further explain the quantitative results. Preliminary descriptive analyses indicated that almost half of the students (49.5%) wanted to go to a Western country for different reasons (e.g., graduate study, temporary settlement, etc.), which is also supported by qualitative data. Besides, the results showed that academic quality, field of study, social networking with other international students, prospect of finding a job in the station country (Turkey), and affordability of the tuition in the station country (Turkey) predict the students’ onward mobility intentions. These results suggest that the lived experiences of international students reestablish the notion of semi-peripheral countries as stepping stones for international students in their stepwise migration trajectories.","Samenvatting: International student mobility (ISM) is often assumed to enhance the labour market prospects of graduates. Studying abroad may signal extracurricular skills and certain personality traits and social class, as ISM is more common among students of higher social origin. Accordingly, one could hypothesize that ISM provides a competitive edge in the labour market. However, studies looking labour market adaptation of graduates with and without ISM experience find limited support for this. This paper investigates the value of ISM from an employer perspective. We address how employers assess higher education from abroad when hiring employees. Data are drawn from the Norwegian Employer survey, conducted by NIFU in 2022. The response rate of this survey is 43, information from more than 10 000 employers are included.  The survey contains an experimental design; employers were presented with hypothetical candidates with different characteristics and asked to indicate how likely they are to hire these. One of the characteristics that varied between the candidates was experience with ISM.  Results show that employers consider graduates who have one year of ISM experience to be just as likely to hire as graduates without ISM experience. The study also looked at employers' assessments of applicants with a full degree abroad versus applicants with an all-Norwegian degree. Employers were less inclined to employ applicants with a diploma from abroad than applicants graduated in Norway. This applies to both graduates with has a Norwegian-sounding name and for graduates a foreign-sounding name, but the effect was stronger for the latter group.","Samenvatting: In the first years of a child’s life, family members play a crucial role as childcare providers. This form of social support helps parents attend to their own needs and responsibilities, including staying connected with friends and participating in the labour market, while ensuring that the child is supervised. However, family childcare is not always available: family conflicts, overburdened grandparents, and geographical distance can leave parents without family help. Previous childcare policy research has largely disregarded how such characteristics of the family network condition the availability of family childcare. Instead, family childcare has been conceptualised in terms of dyadic relationships between family members or family relationships confined within household walls. This narrow understanding of families disregards how childcare arrangements are embedded in family networks comprising a large number of interdependent family members. To address this issue, we argue that the structure and composition of family networks condition whether and how family childcare is available. Using population-scale family network data sourced from administrative registers, we map the availability of family childcare for parents with childcare-age children in the Netherlands. We compare our register-based measures with typical survey-based measures of family childcare for those parents who participate in the LISS survey. We also study how the availability of family childcare varies across parental educational attainment, a central concern in the childcare policy literature. The use of network theory and methods helps us improve upon previous measures of family childcare and provide a large-scale picture of inequality in early childhood in the Netherlands.","Samenvatting: This article analyses the social networks of rural-urban migrant entrepreneurs in Uganda. While social contacts are often an important asset to access resources for migrants, they are often expected to financially support the members of their social networks. These claims for support are here labelled ‘negative social capital’, following Portes’ seminal work. This paper focuses on the kinds of networks that are more likely to produce negative social capital, operationalised here as requests for financial resources, and links this to the discourse on bridging and bonding social capital. By means of a regression analysis, this article provides evidence of dense networks with a higher share of migrants (bonding social capital) being associated with negative social capital. In addition, both a higher share of contacts met before migration, which is related to bonding social capital, and a higher share of contacts living in the city, which is related to bridging social capital, are negatively associated with requests for resources. These findings suggest that migrants can instrumentally keep some contacts from before migration and acquire new key contacts in the urban area.","Samenvatting: Advertisers have increasingly turned towards social media influencers to build brand identities and promote products online, with recent findings indicating a positive correlation between social media use and young adults’ levels of materialism. Focusing on the widely popular TikTok platform, this research asks: how are materialistic values conveyed in American influencer videos? Despite the myriad consequences of materialism – including increased ecologically wasteful behaviors – and indications that materialistic cues in media content may foster a more materialistic value orientation in individuals, little work has explored how materialism is portrayed in new media content. Employing a qualitative Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA) of 100 videos from the top 10 American TikTok influencers, findings of this study indicate that materialism is portrayed in three primary ways: through Physical Appearance, Interaction with Material Items and Brands, and Material Surroundings. Furthermore, materialistic values were found to be mobilized via four significant sub-themes including body language and facial expressions, friends and community, celebrity status and fame, and performing. The results of this research hold implications for stakeholders and individuals concerned with protecting social media users from repeat exposure to materialistic cues that may cultivate a more materialistic value orientation. The findings also support prior evidence that materialism shows up in distinctly gendered ways, and ultimately substantiates current work on influencer marketing and materialism.","Samenvatting: It should come as no surprise that conversational motivations have a profound impact on how the conversations play out. We use conversations to gather information, negotiate norms, seek social aims, and more. Yet, in the context of interpersonal discussion on risk, i.e., risk talk, attention to the role of conversational motivation has hitherto been scattered. While research often finds risk talk to be a significant predictor of risk perception, the direction of this correlation is far from straightforward and often differs between studies. A structured approach to the motivations of risk talk may help us disentangle the relationship between risk talk and risk perception as well as deliver insights into the ways, in which risk is explored, conceptualized, and negotiated at the interpersonal level. Based on a synthesis of existing research within and outside of risk talk research, I highlight the following four main drivers: risk talk as 1) a learning/sensemaking avenue; 2) norm negotiation and identity affirmation; 3) emotional support; and 4) an instrument for social objectives. The novelty of this framework is two-fold. First, the framework facilitates the theoretical distinction and empirical disentanglement of the effects of different motivations for and within risk talk. This also opens the conversation on how individuals actively use risk talk for a variety of purposes rather than risk talk simply being something that occurs to them. Second, the framework holds straightforward applicability to both quantitative and qualitative approaches to risk talk, which will help bridge the division currently existing in the field. \n \n COMMENT: Mijn taalvoorkeur is Engels, maar indien nodig kan het ook in het Nederlands.","Samenvatting: In tijden van toenemende diversiteit en ongelijkheid vormt het behouden van sociale cohesie een cruciale maatschappelijke uitdaging. Positief intergroepscontact speelt een sleutelrol in het samenbrengen van verschillende sociaaleconomische en etnische groepen. Dit contact kan plaatsvinden in verschillende lokale gemeenschappen, waaronder woonbuurten en maatschappelijke organisaties zoals sportclubs. Maar eerder onderzoek laat zien dat deze gemeenschappen vaak gesegregeerd zijn, waardoor de mogelijkheden tot positief intergroepscontact beperkt worden. De precieze oorzaken en gevolgen van segregatie in buurt- en verenigingsleven blijven onduidelijk. Daarom onderzoeken wij in hoeverre segregatie wordt veroorzaakt door ‘homophily’ (de voorkeur voor gemeenschappen met meer mensen die op ons lijken), ten opzichte van homogene ontmoetingskansen. We maken gebruik van surveymodules, uitgevoerd binnen de LISS en TRIAL surveypanels. Ze bevatten rijke gegevens over de sociale samenstelling van de woonbuurten en organisaties van respondenten, en over intergroepscontact binnen deze gemeenschappen. Daarnaast bevatten ze keuze-experimenten, waarin respondenten kiezen tussen buurten en organisaties die verschillen in, onder andere, hun sociaaleconomische en etnische samenstellingen. Hiermee brengen we in kaart wat de voorkeuren zijn van mensen met betrekking tot de sociale samenstelling van lokale gemeenschappen, hoe dit afhangt van het type gemeenschap, en hoe dit verschilt tussen sociale groepen. Voorlopige bevindingen suggereren dat hoger opgeleide personen buurten en organisaties vermijden die hen in contact zouden brengen met lager opgeleiden personen. Etnische segregatie kan daarentegen niet worden verklaard door voorkeuren voor etnische gelijkenis. Kortom, ons onderzoek biedt inzicht in de ontstaanswijze en het voortbestaan van segregatie in buurt- en verenigingsleven, en daarmee hoe lokale gemeenschappen intergroepscontact kunnen belemmeren.","Samenvatting: Precarious jobs can be experienced as precarity of work (i.e., related to the continuity of work), at work (i.e., unsafe working conditions), or from work (i.e., holding a job that does not meet one’s basic needs). Within all three, precarity may translate into engagement with work and individuals’ wider lives. Resilience is one understanding of why and how precarity experienced within one’s job may unfold differently for various people. Whether or not individuals resiliently cope in relation to their precarious work may be tied to personal, social, and historical dynamics. Our study aims to better understanding of whether (or not) precarity on the job translates to precarity in life for individual workers, their families, and the social context in which citizens participate.\n \tWhile working alongside participants we asked (1) the origin of and experience at work, (2) what work entailed and future considerations, and (3) situated precarity in life. We will thematically code all references of precarity of work, at work, and from work, and related precarity in their (social) lives. Last, we synthesize collective findings to get an understanding of precarity as a social phenomenon.\n           Preliminary understanding, based on informal interactions, indicate that precarity on the job not always translates to precarity in life, especially not for older citizens. Resilience is often viewed as an individual character or as patterns within labor market(s). Our preliminary finding hint towards a more social dynamic of resilience; when experienced precarity on the job does not automatically translates into the wider lives of individual citizens, this is often due to specific social dynamics within the lives of citizens (e.g., the possibility to help others, having (social) autonomy). \n            Our findings emphasize the heterogeneity of precarity, which may be best explained as a social phenomenon instead of an individual one. \n \n","Samenvatting: Taste in music, literature, and the arts has been a rich site for studying the relationship between culture and stratification for decades. This work consistently finds that socioeconomic status shapes the volume of culture consumed, yet questions about the breadth of musical tastes remain. The effects of racial and ethnic inequality also remain submerged in most of the existing research; serving as controls but little more. To address these issues, we use regression analysis to differentiate between the volume of cultural items and the breadth of taste patterns. Using two years of the Survey of Public Participation in the Arts (2008, 2012) (n=2,773), the findings suggest that volume and breadth are shaped by different kinds of social hierarchy. The sheer volume of cultural items selected is predicted by parental education levels (inherited cultural capital), but the breadth of choices is more clearly shaped by race/ethnicity differences. The taste patterns of Whites tend to have less breadth than those of Blacks, Hispanics, or Asians in the US. These findings confirm existing qualitative work which suggests that minorities have to navigate between dominant and non-dominant cultural worlds, in a way that their White counterparts do not. We argue that a strict focus on socioeconomic status in taste research has been short-sighted; and that considering how patterns have been shaped by race/ethnicity is long overdue.","Samenvatting: Live music is finding increasing space in the digital sphere, with musicians utilizing digital platforms to perform for virtual audiences while acquiring new revenue streams. Twitch - a leading livestreaming platform known originally for gaming content - is a prime example of this, providing musicians infrastructure for social relations and voluntary monetary contributions all from the comfort of their homes. The social nature of Twitch allows artists to interact with their audience yielding various forms of exchange, with direct and indirect requests for monetary support intertwined with intimate interaction moments. Through a video analysis of twenty livestreamed performances from the twenty top rated Twitch artists (57 hours 59 mins), this paper maps these interactions asking how artists navigate the public/private space to exert gift giving. We frame our analysis based on Zelizer's economic-sociological perspectives and further discuss Twitch interactions as supporting a particular \"circuit of commerce\" where intimacy and money intertwine, giving rise to an online busking practice. Online busking through Twitch becomes possible due to two main factors: a) the household becoming the locus of production, distribution, and exchange, and b) the standardized interaction rituals intermediated by an online social infrastructure that codifies meaning into symbols, money, words and audiovisuals. While interacting in these settings, audiences and artists bridge the gaps between solidarity and monetary transactions by repeating patterns, thus making online twitching a special form of busking, one highly standardized, where artists ritualize the moment to personalize a rather impersonal space, forming an online community.","Samenvatting: Combining insights from studies on hegemonic masculinity and feminist geography this research examines how young, white, cisgender, and straight men negotiate masculinity in inclusive nightlife spaces in Rotterdam. Inclusive nightlife spaces blur the boundaries between marked and unmarked identities, and this historically privileged and unmarked group seems to respond to inclusivity policies in various ways. Therefore, it is needed to address majorities’, not only minorities, experiences of inclusive and safe nightlife spaces to better understand how safety and inclusivity can be stimulated.  The research draws from 14 semi-structured interviews, with participants recruited from inclusive nightlife. The findings suggest that hegemonic masculinity is renegotiated via two strategies: 1. inconspicuous masculinity, and 2. transactional masculinity. Through inconspicuous masculinity the men make their masculinity less visible. Typical hegemonic masculine practices such as chasing girls and excessive drinking become inconspicuous in inclusive spaces. Through transactional masculinity generally subordinate masculine practices, such as caring for others, are traded into new practices by framing it in other masculine meanings, such as protectors of minorities. However, the inclusive nightlife venues seem to be situated in a paradox of inclusivity. Namely, some participants felt repressed and considered themselves part of a ‘marginalised majority’, as they perceived the inclusive venues as exclusive of non-minorities. This study finds that attempts to foster an inclusive nightlife may not be as straightforward as to ‘just’ include everyone. Rather, the findings suggest that blurring boundaries through inclusivity policies may stimulate polarization between marked and unmarked groups more than bonding between the various social groups.","Samenvatting: Music affects physiological and social well-being. Medical research shows that individual engagement with preferred music can mitigate anxiety, stress, and pain. Concurrently, sociological research shows that music can foster a sense of community through the physical co-presence of audience and artists, facilitating a shared focus and generating a feeling of “togetherness.” What is missing, is an integrated approach that merges medical and sociological perspectives. Little is known about the physiological effects of music outside the clinical setting. Additionally, existing medical studies predominantly concentrate on classical music, thereby a priori disregarding potential well-being benefits offered by popular music. Also, little is known about the relationship between the physiological responses induced by concerts and their subjective experiential aspects. To address these gaps, we (Erasmus University, Erasmus Medical Center, and the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra) carried out an experiment in which 145 participants attended classical and pop concerts. To assess physiological well-being, we measured participants’ Heart Rate Variability (HRV), which indicates whether they were relaxed or stressed. To gauge social well-being, participants filled out surveys about their enjoyment of the music, and the connection they felt with the performers, other audience members, and to people in general. As a control, half of the participants attended the concerts livestreamed in a nearby hall. At the time of writing, the analysis is being prepared. We look forward to discuss our preliminary findings.","Samenvatting: Work in the creative industries, and music in particular, is often seen as rewarding, highlighting the freedom enjoyed by creatives, and foreground the passion they have for their work. Yet, those rewards rarely translate into generous financial rewards (Been et al., 2023). Moreover, the rewards creatives obtain from their activities are also distributed unevenly, structurally disadvantaging different demographic groups (Brook et al., 2020), particularly women. Earlier research, for example, has shown that income from music royalties for men is three times higher than that of women (Berkers et al., 2019), and the ample existing research on self-reported income shows profound differences here as well (Berkers et al., 2019). However, self-reported data is notoriously unreliable and income from royalties is limited whereas live music has become increasingly important in the business models of artists. Hence, this study examines gender differences in artist guarantees for live concerts, drawing on a unique database from a leading Dutch booking agency (n= 20,000). Preliminary results show a clear gender pay gap but also shows a more nuanced picture where we find differences between music genres.","Samenvatting: Sociologists have scrutinized the unique features of labour conditions in the cultural industries – and the music industries specifically - the methodological implications for researching in this sector have not been given much attention (McRobbie 2016; Everts 2023). Music professionals are characterised by high cultural capital but relatively low economic capital: while (senior) employees have considerable cultural influence as key gatekeepers, their financial situation often does not always reflect an elite status (Brook et al. 2020). Music sector workers navigate an industry ‘in crisis’ with limited space and resources available (Hesmondhalgh and Baker 2011), while gatekeeping practices reproduce or legitimise social inequalities (Negus 1999). Based on a qualitative research project on a specific subgroup of music professionals (nightclub promoters), this paper explores how qualitative interviews could attune better to the specific conditions of the music industries. First, methodological literature often conceptualises the power in interview setting through the relationship between interviewer and interviewee (Ellersgaard et al. 2022). However, engaging with literature on whiteness (Ahlstedt 2015), the paper argues that researchers share a ‘sameness’ with interviewees that obscures the workings of power during interviews. Second, the informal work culture of the music industries adds to complexities around gaining access to elites: a particular ‘elite informality’. Third, talking about music is like dancing about architecture – or is there a good way to get at music professionals’ poetics? The paper adds to recent methodological debates in qualitative sociology that understand power as fluid and context-dependent rather than static (Lancaster 2017; Ellersgaard et al. 2022).","Samenvatting: Music managers play a key role in the music industry, mediating between the artist, the audience and other key stakeholders. Yet, we know relatively little about this profession. How does one become a music manager? What education and skills are needed? What are the main challenges these professionals run into? Based on a survey (n=300) and in-depth interviews, we address the question what it means to be a music manager? Preliminary results show that - highly educated – most managers did not gain the skills they use in music management from degree programs. Most learned by doing. They identify managing the vulnerability, health and or well-being of artists as the most important skill. The main challenges are financial and time management issues.","Samenvatting: The 1989 fall of Romanian socialism spurred the transition toward a unique form of neoliberal capitalism. Although much has been written on the transformation of Eastern European economies, little is known about how cultural actors from the music sector have made sense of the abrupt evaporation of a seemingly monolithic cultural system and unshakable way of life. Making use of extensive archival research, this contribution traces the development of Romanian musicians and policymakers in their transition from socialism to capitalism: if under socialism, the state embodies the central power at the top of the political pyramid which relies on the skills of musicians to legitimise itself and reorganise social values, with the transition to capitalism, ‘the state’ is replaced by ‘the market’ at the core of the socio-cultural imaginary. Our analysis offers a nuanced examination of the altered dynamics post-1989, exploring how the ‘rules of the game’ change and how cultural actors navigate for economic (financial gains) and symbolic capital (artistic prestige). Faced with both opportunities and challenges, these cultural actors do not only have to find and make meaning from the shadows of and within the music industry, but ultimately must adapt their cultural toolkits and remodel discourses and practices according to a new logic: the cultural logic of uncertainty that defines post-socialist capitalism.","Samenvatting: This study analyses the value of qualifications in the Surinamese education system and develops an SRLED (Surinamese Level of Education) using optimal scaling in a large-scale dataset (SURMOB2012, N=3929). We conceive of the value of a qualification as deriving from two related but not identical processes:\n •\tThe value in the labour market and the marriage market: to what level of jobs, income and spouse does a certain qualification lead?\n •\tThe value of qualifications is revealed by the competition of low and high status parents.\n \n Technically, this constitutes an optimal scaling model in which qualifications operate as the mediator between social origins and social destinations.  The resulting scale values of SRLED are broadly arranged according to the primary, junior secondary, senior secondary and tertiary levels, but the value of vocational and academic tracks varies between these levels: vocational qualifications score better at lower levels and academic tracks at the higher levels. Incomplete qualification generally obtains a value below a completed qualification, but above the next lower lever: incomplete education is valuable and does not – overall – create a scar in the Surinamese context.\n The issue of whether or not to include incomplete qualifications in the measurement of education has special relevance to the ISSP and other projects that have adopted the recently developed International Standard Classification of Education 2011 as its coding frame. ISCED-2011, a three digit coding systems, allows for the proper classification of incomplete qualifications by its third digit.","Samenvatting: Against the background of population ageing and policies to stimulate longer working lives, this study examines poverty among older people and retirees in Europe along well-established lines of social stratification: employment status, age, gender, education and (last) occupation. Prior studies have shown that generous state pensions are able to alleviate poverty, that is, in countries that provide higher state pension income, poverty is less prevalent among the older population. However, it is unclear to what extent state pension systems are also able to alleviate social inequality in poverty. Welfare state theories predict that especially social categories that are vulnerable to end up in poverty gain resources from welfare benefits. When thinking of such benefits, people commonly think of unemployment or housing benefits, but old-age benefits are also part of a country’s welfare provisions. Exploiting two decades of European Social Survey data, this study examines this open question by looking at differences in poverty between people with and without a paid job, between people with different ages (even in the sample restricted to older individuals), between men and women, between the lower and higher educated, and between those who occupy or occupied (if fully retired) lower- and higher-status jobs. It also explores whether social inequality in poverty has increased over time. What has been the impact of increases in statutory retirement ages? Have certain social categories been hit disproportionately? Answering these questions will identify social groups that face higher risks of poverty in old age and may provide clear policy implications.","Samenvatting: This study employs the intersectionality framework to quantitatively investigate social inequalities in the returns of resources in benefit receipt at the intersection of gender, migration background, and age. Conventionally, studies aiming to explore underlying mechanisms for inequalities in benefit receipt have focused on the association with resource deficits (i.e., economic, social, cultural, and person capital) and benefit receipt. The implicit assumption commonly used in these studies is that the returns of resources are homogenous. However, a well-documented phenomenon is that certain social groups may experience diminished returns on their capitals. Therefore, the research question of this paper reads: To what extend do the effects of economic, social, cultural an person capital on benefit receipt vary at the intersection of gender, migration background and age? Using a unique combination of register and longitudinal survey data, I estimate Longitudinal Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (longitudinal MAIHDA). We find possitive associations between economic and person capital and benefit receipt, with social capital showing significance when uncontrolled for other capitals. Secondly, we find that economic capital may have a buffering effect for disadvantaged groups, but that this effect works two ways and acts as a double-edged sword. In social groups with a stronger positive association between economic capital and benefit receipt, people with fewer economic resources may be disproportionately vulnerable to benefit receipt. The findings underscore the imperative consideration of intersectional complexities in quantitative analyses and advocate for tailored interventions that recognize diverse resource impacts on distinct social groups.","Samenvatting: The economic and cultural dimensions of stratification are well known. However, in Turkey, political and religious dynamics intersect in unique ways, alongside economic and cultural aspects. This intersection serves as the primary inspiration and foundation of this research, aimed at exploring the complexity of lifestyle differences and the diverse factors that shape them. The argument posited in this research is grounded in the premise that lifestyle differences are multifaceted, influenced not solely by economic variables or access to resources, but also by the interplay of immaterial aspects such as religion, politics, and morality. The objective of this research is to investigate how sub-groups within the middle class, characterized by their lifestyles, vary in establishing symbolic boundaries shaped by socio-economic, cultural, religious, political, and moral dynamics. To accomplish this objective, the chapter utilizes Lamont’s (1992) conceptual framework of symbolic boundary work, which builds upon Bourdieu’s (1984) foundational ideas. This framework helps to explore how individuals categorize and evaluate various lifestyles, including their own, by creating distinct boundaries for differentiation. Drawing on 36 in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with middle-class individuals who frequent Mado, a local chain of cafes and restaurants in Istanbul, this study identifies four distinct lifestyle groups within each sub-group of the middle class: 1) cultured exclusives, 2) intellectuals, 3) money-runner jump-ups, and 4) religion-loving conservatives. By considering religious, political, and moral dynamics, this study addresses gaps in social stratification research by utilizing empirical data from a non-Euro-American context.","Samenvatting: The occupational aspirations of children have been found to depend on children’s social origins. However, it remains unclear what in an occupation is valued more by which children. Previous research has focused on predicting aspirations in terms of aspired socioeconomic status (SES) rather than predicting the actual aspired occupation. By doing so it cannot explain whether aspirations are stratified because 1) children from higher social origins have a stronger preference for occupations with high SES or because 2) they have a stronger preference for certain types of occupations regardless of the occupations’ SES. This study seeks to address this gap by assessing which occupational characteristics increase or lower the probability that a given occupation is aspired. In this regard, occupational stereotypes are argued to play a central role. Stereotypes are a crucial source of information when children form their aspirations. Additionally, varying social origins may affect the way children evaluate those stereotypes contributing to the stratification of aspirations. By leveraging word embeddings to map over 10,000 occupation titles in a cultural space, I measure their stereotypical images. This information alongside SES and Swiss data on occupational aspirations is used to estimate conditional logit models predicting occupational aspirations. These models allow me to assess which occupational characteristics are most influential for occupational aspirations and whether their influence depends on children’s social origin. By delving into occupational stereotypes in addition to SES, this study aims to illuminate the nuanced factors contributing to the stratification of children's occupational aspirations.","Samenvatting: In the past decades, family life has changed. People remain single more often, enter relationships later, are less likely to marry and more likely to dissolve a relationship. We know little about what these trends imply for the living arrangements of those aged 30 to 60. This age group is interesting, because it is traditionally viewed as the main period in which people establish a family of their own. I pool data from 10 Rounds of the European Social Survey to examine trends in the living arrangements of middle adults across Europe. Key questions I want to answer are: 1. To what extent is ‘traditional’ family life (i.e. being married with kids) on the retreat across Europe? How large are the differences in this regard? 2. Is this retreat apparent among all social strata? I expect a retreat from “traditional family life” across Europe, but that this retreat is stronger in countries with more individualized values and in countries with poor arrangements to combine work and family life.","Samenvatting: Ruud Luijkx took over the role of national coordinator of the International Social Survey Programme from Harry Ganzeboom.

Over the same period, birth rates also declined markedly. These developments are not unique to the Netherlands, but can also be found – to a varying extent – in many other rich societies. This raises the question to what extent housing conditions inhibit young adults from having children, and whether this depends on the macro-level situation on the housing market. To explore this question, the present study uses data from the Generations and Gender Survey (GGS) to examine how young adults’ housing conditions are associated with their fertility intentions. First, I investigate how characteristics of individuals’ homes – including homeownership, the number of rooms, and satisfaction with one’s home – are associated with the intention to have a(nother) child in the next three years. Second, I examine to what extent respondents themselves report living in housing that is suitable for having a(nother) child. In both analyses I will compare results for the Netherlands with those for other countries for which recent data are available, using macro-level housing market indicators – such as the availability of public housing, the house-price-to-income ratio, and the accessibility of mortgages – to explain potential differences in findings between countries. This allows me to explore the hypothesis that a (perceived) lack of high-quality, child-friendly housing constitutes a stronger barrier to having children in countries where housing is less accessible and less affordable.","Samenvatting: As large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, continue to evolve, by being trained on vast corpora of human-generated data, a pivotal question emerges: to what extent do LLMs begin to mirror not only the linguistic and cognitive capabilities of humans but also venture into the realm of strategic thinking and social behaviour? To answer this question, we ask three existing LLMs: ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard, to play each against themselves in economic trust games and we compare the results to those obtained using real human players. More specifically, we designed three variants of economic trust games with role play  of LLMs to test if these models can integrate strategic reasoning with social understanding, such as how to play as a selfish or reciprocal player. We also compare repeated versus one-shot trust games, which require different levels of strategic reasoning. We found that LLMs are able to “play” selfishly or reciprocally in a given context. This implies the training process of LLMs extends beyond language acquisition to the learning of norms and values embedded. Nevertheless, LLMs still struggle to make consistent decisions, which integrate both strategic reasoning and social understanding as we observe in real human players.","Samenvatting: The public continuously seeks scientific expertise on pressing issues and the scientists are becoming increasingly conscious of the importance of engaging with the public through different media outlets. Yet, time in the spotlight is unequally distributed between women and men in science. The underrepresentation of women in the public sphere can exacerbate stereotypes of science as a domain more suitable for men and deepen the gender gap in scientific representation. Here, we contribute to the understanding of gender differences in media representation in two ways. We first evaluate whether gender inequalities in media representation are exacerbated by cumulative advantage where reputable scientists accrue further recognition, while the unrecognized ones increasingly lag behind. Second, we suggest the presence of so-called social network “second-order” cumulative advantage: the cumulative advantage of the media popularity of scientists’ social ties (i.e., coauthors) flows over to increasingly benefit the focal scholar. We expect that the advantages of having similarly popular ties might differ between men and women, further exacerbating the gender/media representation gap. We obtain the full list of professors at Dutch universities in 2021 and reconstruct their entire careers through metadata of their academic publications, citations, (past) institutional affiliations, and information about 1.35 million co-authors. We further crosswalk the scholarly data to media data using the LexisNexis and Altmetric databases. Our dataset allows us to understand to what extent cumulative advantage drives the success of “superstar” professors, and whether these dynamics exacerbate gender difference in media presence over time.","Samenvatting: Segregation and polarisation are two pressing societal problems. Residential segregation, along ethnic, economic or other key social dimensions, exacerbates social inequality and hampers inter-group contact and trust. Political polarisation both breeds and is further fuelled by echo-chambers in social media, which provide fertile grounds for the spreading of falsehoods and further extremization. Division lines in society running across geographic space (i.e. segregation) or opinion space (i.e. polarisation) can lead to group conflict and threaten the functioning of democracy. \nExperimental work – artificial computer experiments and small-scale lab experiments – showed that segregation and polarization are interconnected, but exactly how remains elusive. Large scale empirical work with observational data on their relationship is, however, lacking. We simply do not know how these phenomena are interrelated in the societies we live in and when and where a vicious circle may arise in which segregation and polarization between groups may mutually reinforce each other. Knowledge on the empirical association of the phenomena and evidence of their causal interconnection is pivotal in understanding potential threats to democracy and societal cohesion. This project, therefore, aims to answer the following research question: \n\nHow, when and where is residential segregation related to political polarization in the Netherlands?\n\nTo move the field forward, this project will take a (theoretically informed) computationally intensive data-driven approach. First, we will discuss how to define, identify and visualize different patterns of residential segregation. We will pay special attention to issues of scale – and by extension to spatial measures of segregation –, acknowledging that both patterns of segregation and consequences of segregation may be scale dependent. We will use techniques of spatial analysis and social network analysis and take full advantage of the available fine-grained spatial data of Statistics Netherlands. Second, we will investigate how these segregation patterns are related to polarized voting behavior. Our data source for the latter will be election results at the polling station level for the last two election rounds (2021 and 2023).","Samenvatting: Social media play an increasingly important role in society, as related to the diffusion of (dis)information, polarization, civic and political participation, wellbeing, and social cohesion. However, by far most of the research on social media focusses on the “traditional” social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook but largely ignores mobile instant messenger services (MIMSs) such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, even though these  meanwhile rival social media platforms in popularity. A key reason for the scarcity of research is that in contrast to traditional social media platforms, MIMSs are hardly accessible to researchers since they typically lack a public web interface and any centrally collected data are proprietary. As a result, the scarce empirical research on MIMSs relies on specific publicly accessible WhatsApp groups or on surveys among small convenience samples. Consequently, this research provides little insight in the overall network topology of instant messenger networks: we lack knowledge about even the most basic topological features of the societal-scale instant messenger network.\n\nWhile MIMS data are not directly accessible to researchers, the EU General Data Protection Regulation grants users themselves the right to electronic copies of their data. Taking advantage of this fact, we employ the innovative approach of data donation respondents of a high-quality panel in the Netherlands to collect user data while preserving their privacy. Focusing on WhatsApp as the most popular MIMS, this study collects the first measurement of MIMS usage on a nationally probability sample.\n\nWe report first results for a data collected among respondents of the LISS panel in early 2023. We describe core features of the network topology, the group structure, and socio-economic predictors of use patterns. Furthermore, we assess the method in terms of selectivity and validity.","Samenvatting: The current research employed a person-centered and domain-specific approach to examine Belgian majority group members’ expectations regarding immigrant acculturation in private and public domains, utilizing a large-scale national probability sample. Applying latent profile analysis we identified three expectation profiles: Those who made a clear distinction between the public and private domain, expecting assimilation to Belgian culture in public but favoring immigrants maintaining their heritage culture in private (“public-private distinction”, 58.7%); those who expected assimilation (“assimilation”, 13.2%), and those who favored integration of Belgian culture and immigrant’s heritage culture (“integration”, 28.1%) regardless of the domain. Subsequent multinomial logistic regression revealed that the profiles differed in perceived symbolic threat, with those in the integration profile feeling the least, and those in the assimilationist profile most threatened. Moreover, we found that those in the integration profile were more likely to have intergroup friends than those in the assimilationist profile, and they supported religious expression in public more. Our findings illustrate the value of employing a simultaneous person-centered and domain specific approach. In the absence of our person-centered approach, we might have captured only an overall preference for adoption in public and maintenance at home, rather than the three identified profiles, which show that this does not hold true for all participants. Conversely, had we only examined the public domain, we might have concluded that over 70% strongly expect assimilation. Taken together, we thus encourage researchers to adopt both a person-centered and domain-specific approach when examining acculturation attitudes and expectations.","Samenvatting: The interethnic contact literature has traditionally examined interactions between members of discrete, mutually exclusive ethnic groups. However, many people with a migration background identify with both the ethnicity of their (grand)parents and with the national majority in the host country, combining these identities into a dual identity (e.g., ‘Turkish-Dutch’). We argue that contact with dual identifiers might result in particularly positive intergroup relations, as for many people, dual identifiers are in- and outgroup members at the same time.\n \n Therefore, we examined to what extent people identifying with only one ethnic group hold more positive attitudes towards ethnic outgroups when they have contact with dual identifiers. In Study 1 (N = 659), we used cross-sectional ego-centered network data collected among native Dutch adults, measuring contact with dual identifiers based on the perceived ethnic belonging of friends. In Study 2 (N = 1,486), we used longitudinal whole network data collected in German schools, and measured contact with dual identifiers based on the self-reported dual identification of friends.\n \n Study 1 showed that contact with minority members perceived as dual identifiers strongly related to more positive outgroup attitudes, even more strongly than contact with those perceived as belonging to the ethnic outgroup only. However, Study 2 showed that contact with people self-identifying as dual identifiers was not significantly related to outgroup attitudes, suggesting that contact with dual identifiers can play a particularly influential role in improving intergroup relations, but only when dual identifiers are perceived as such.\n","Samenvatting: Harmonious intergroup relations are key to peaceful, democratic societies. Fortunately, a treasure trove of academic work addresses how people come to accept or reject others, such as majorities’ attitudes concerning ethnic minorities. However, most studies focus on minorities as objects of exclusion. Consequently, we currently know markedly little about how minorities themselves view other stigmatized groups. As societies are becoming increasingly diverse, expanding our understanding of inclusion not only of but also by minorities is vital.\n \n The insights we do have seem contradictory. Some argue that minorities lash out against other stigmatized groups to gain power and status. Others conversely argue that marginalized groups are inclusive, to not do onto others as is done onto them. As both perspectives have gained some empirical support, the answer to “are minorities more or less inclusive than dominant majorities?” seems to be “it depends”. The present study addresses the logical follow-up question: on what? More specifically, I theorize and empirically test under what conditions ethno-religious minorities support homosexuality, women’s rights, and migration.\n \n Refining and synthesizing insights from diverse disciplines including sociology, political science, psychology, and gender studies, I build a theoretical framework that emphasizes four conditions for inclusivity by minorities: a) the minority group itself; b) the outgroup; c) the outgroup attitude (e.g., thin tolerance versus thick support); and d) the extent to which societies marginalize the minority group and the outgroup. I empirically test my framework using recent European and World Values Surveys on 90 contexts (2017-2022) and multilevel regression analyses.\n","Samenvatting: Much of the debate on migrant integration in Western European societies centers around Muslims. Public attitudes towards Muslims are rather negative and Muslims experience relatively high levels of discrimination. However, research tends to neglect the variability in attitudes towards specific subgroups of Muslims. That is, public opinion research typically assesses Islamophobia by measuring attitudes towards Muslims in general. Yet, in order to understand Islamophobia, we need to delve deeper and assess how and why attitudes may vary towards specific subgroups of Muslims. Based on two large surveys among Dutch adolescents and adults, we firstly assess to what extent Muslims are evaluated more negatively than other groups. Secondly, we assess differences in attitudes towards specific subcategories of Muslims, e.g. males versus females, young versus old, and those originating from different countries of origin. We find a clear and rather consensual hierarchy in attitudes. Firstly, in line with Ethnic Hierarchy theory and classic studies in the Netherlands, we find a consensual hierarchy in attitudes towards different groups: Muslims are evaluated more negative than Surinamese or Antilleans, with Moroccans at the lower end of the hierarchy. Moreover, we also find a hierarchical pattern in attitudes towards specific Muslim subgroups, with young and male Muslims at the bottom of the hierarchy. Finally, we test to what extent these hierarchies are shared among different social categories within the Netherlands. We discuss how these hierarchical patterns shed light on the drivers and manifestation of Islamophobia.","Samenvatting: Given an increasing need to balance caregiving with employment, many caregivers face challenges in maintaining consistent paid work, potentially risking employment disadvantages that accumulate over the life-course. Using a life-course perspective, this study examines the impact of unpaid caregiving trajectories on mid-life employment outcomes including employment status, job satisfaction, and wages. Furthermore, we study how outcomes differ by gender and education, as some trajectories might be particularly disadvantaging for certain demographic groups. The `path-dependency’ of life-courses implies that providing care earlier in life makes it more likely to pick up caregiving later as well, often at the expense of paid work. This suggests that carer`s employment outcomes are shaped by the accumulation of multiple care episodes and their consequences, rather than by isolated instances. Thus, we build on caregiving trajectories that include both childcare and informal care episodes for up to 50 years of the life course until 2020 (N=1,630), using retrospective survey data on informal care combined with longitudinal childcare data from the LISS Panel. Using regression models and longitudinal employment information obtained from LISS, we investigate to what extent these trajectories are associated with employment status, job satisfaction, and wages across ages 45-55, and how these vary by gender and education. As providing care can be in conflict with employment, care-heavy trajectories particularly when prolonged and intensive, are expected to result in more negative employment outcomes in mid-life, with variations across demographic groups.","Samenvatting: Tegen de achtergrond van 1) demografische ontwikkelingen, zoals de stijging van het aantal (oude) ouderen en (daarmee) het aantal mensen met een chronische aandoening, 2) minder publiek betaalde zorgvoorzieningen, en 3) het beleidsstreven om meer (parttimers meer uren) en langer (verschuiving pensioenleeftijd) te werken, zal het aantal werkenden met mantelzorgtaken de komende jaren toenemen. Uit SCP onderzoek blijkt dat nu al circa twee miljoen mensen een betaalde baan met mantelzorgtaken combineren; het gaat over 31% van de werkende vrouwen en 22% van de werkende mannen. Arbeid, onderwijs, langdurige zorg en mantelzorg komen in het leven van burgers bij elkaar; hoe deze combinatie verloopt naar gelang de levensloop, is nog onduidelijk. Om die reden onderzoeken VU en SCP in een samenwerkingsverband welke werkende mantelzorgers (geen) problemen ervaren met de combinatie van werk en zorg, en hoe dit verschilt per levensfase (16-34, 34-54, 54+). Op basis van SCP Informele Zorg 2019 en met behulp van latente klasse analyse worden levensfase-specifieke profielen opgesteld van werkende mantelzorgers. Input voor de latente klasse analyse zijn levensfase, kenmerken van de werk- en zorgsituatie en positieve en negatieve uitkomsten van de combinatie werken en zorgen. De resultaten geven inzicht in wat belangrijker is voor ervaren belasting – de werk- of de zorgsituatie - en of de combinatie in sommige levensfasen als zwaarder belastend wordt ervaren dan in andere. Waar nodig worden ook verschillen naar gender beschreven. ","Samenvatting: In vergrijzende samenlevingen wordt het steeds belangrijker dat buren op elkaar kunnen rekenen voor hulp wanneer ze niet meer in staat zijn om een taak zelf uit te voeren. Bij dit soort hulp (ook wel mantelzorg) speelt wederkerigheid een belangrijke rol. Hulp teruggeven kan echter lastig zijn voor mensen met gezondheidsproblemen. Als de motivatie om buren te helpen grotendeels op wederkerigheid zou berusten, is de kans klein dat mensen bereid zijn mantelzorg te bieden aan hun buren. In dit onderzoek beantwoorden we de vraag in hoeverre wederkerigheid een rol speelt in het verlenen van mantelzorg aan buren. Daarbij gaan we ook in op eerdere (mantel)zorgervaringen. Uit eerder onderzoek blijkt immers dat mensen die al eens mantelzorg hebben verleend een grotere kans hebben om dat opnieuw te doen. Mogelijk zouden deze ervaringen ook de rol van wederkerigheid kunnen verkleinen. Negatieve ervaringen met mantelzorg zouden daarentegen de rol van wederkerigheid kunnen vergroten. Om dit te onderzoeken combineren we twee enquêtes onder het LISS panel, namelijk een retrospectieve vragenlijst over mantelzorgervaringen en een vignettenexperiment over hulp aan buren (met gezondheidsproblemen) waarin wederkerigheid één van de dimensies is. Ons sample bestaat uit 1343 vignetten onder 882 respondenten. Voorlopige resultaten wijzen uit dat mensen een grotere bereidheid hebben om mantelzorg te bieden aan buren wanneer ze dachten ooit hulp terug te krijgen. Dit was echter alleen het geval wanneer mensen eerdere mantelzorgervaringen hadden. Mogelijke wederkerigheid deed er niet toe wanneer men nog nooit mantelzorg verleend had.","Samenvatting: This study aims to understand how the composition of older people’s social networks affect the uptake of public social care - either provided by (1) compensated informal caregivers or (2) professionals. Recent reforms in Dutch long-term care policies have sought to increase the involvement of social networks in the provision of care, which is reflective of an international trend of attempts to substitute professional care with cheaper alternatives. Public social care is only provided once the help of family, friends or neighbors is exhausted, in which case citizens may opt for professional care in kind or a personal budget to employ professionals or informal caregivers. The emphasis of informal care in reforms like these have been argued to perpetuate socio-economic and gender inequalities, as women and unemployed people are more likely to take on (compensated or uncompensated) informal caregiving tasks, including the associated burdens and precariousness. We therefore expect that citizens with a higher availability of women and unemployed people in their network are less likely to receive public professional care, but more likely to receive (financially compensated) informal care. To test these assumptions we will use registry data from Statistics Netherlands from 2015-2022, which allows us to measure public care receipt and to identify networks of family and neighbors of all older-aged individuals in the Netherlands. Moreover, we are able to identify the financially compensated informal caregivers, which enables us to more precisely test with whom the care recipient is most likely to form or maintain an informal care tie.","Samenvatting: De steeds groter wordende vraag naar langdurige zorg kan oudere Nederlanders en hun naasten voor grote uitdagingen stellen. Publieke zorgvoorziening is beperkt, maar ook families worden kleiner. Daarom is het belangrijk voor ouderen met een zorgvraag dat verschillende leden van hun sociale netwerk mantelzorg verlenen, niet alleen partners en kinderen, maar ook andere familieleden of vrienden. Wij weten echter nog weinig over hoe sociale netwerken zorgnetwerken opbouwen. Met dit onderzoek willen wij analyseren hoe verschillende kenmerken van sociale netwerken beïnvloeden welk type zorg ouderen krijgen. Hierbij gaat het om de omvang, de compositie en de kwaliteit van het netwerk. Dit wordt onderzocht met hulp van een sample van de Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA), dat bestaat uit 18252 observaties uit de jaren 1992 tot 2022 van 4859 thuiswonende Nederlandse ouderen. Hiermee hebben wij typische zorgnetwerken in Nederland geïdentificeerd en 7 groepen gevonden (zorg door kinderen, partners, andere familieleden, andere netwerkleden, formele zorg en privé betaalde zorg). Eerste resultaten laten zien dat ouderen met een groter netwerk meer mantelzorg ontvangen, maar dat vooral de compositie van het netwerk belangrijk is: Partners en kinderen die in de buurt wonen en spelen de belangrijkste rol in een zorgnetwerk. Opvallend is dat het hebben van netwerkleden die veel emotionele steun bieden niet per se leidt tot mantelzorg. Dit komt mogelijk omdat ouderen hun naasten niet teveel willen belasten.","Samenvatting: Er wordt steeds nadrukkelijker verwacht dat zorg- en welzijnsprofessionals mantelzorgers actief betrekken, ondersteunen en met hen samenwerken. In de praktijk is het echter niet altijd vanzelfsprekend dat goede samenwerkingsrelaties tot stand komen. In deze kwalitatieve studie zijn 37 mantelzorgers eerst individueel geïnterviewd. Daarna namen zij deel aan acht focusgroepen waarin de voorkeuren van mantelzorgers ten aanzien van samenwerking met professionals zijn verkend. Omdat er een groeiend besef is dat professionals hun werkwijze zouden moeten afstemmen op de individuele omstandigheden van mantelzorgers, is in het onderzoek een intersectioneel perspectief toegepast om de relatie tussen sociale posities van mantelzorgers en hun voorkeuren ten aanzien van samenwerking te onderzoeken. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat de meeste zorgen van mantelzorgers rond samenwerking voortkomen uit de organisatorische contexten waarin interacties tussen hen en professionals plaatsvinden. Verschillende sociale posities van mantelzorgers – zoals hun leeftijd, sociaal economische positie en het al dan niet hebben van een migratieachtergrond – leiden niet zozeer tot verschillende wensen ten aanzien van samenwerking met professionals. Mantelzorgers willen echter wel dat professionals oog hebben voor hun sociale posities, omdat die de context vormen van waaruit mantelzorg wordt gegeven en dus (mede) bepalen hoe gemakkelijk mantelzorgers het geven van zorg kunnen integreren in hun leven. Om samenwerking tussen mantelzorgers en professionals te verbeteren, moeten professionals aangemoedigd worden om mantelzorgers te zien en erkennen als gelijkwaardige partners in de zorg. Het is essentieel dat professionals manieren zoeken om samen zorg vorm te geven en daarbij bestaande relaties tussen mantelzorgers en zorgvragers centraal stellen.","Samenvatting: Oudere zorgontvangers verschillen in de soorten zorg die ze krijgen: sommigen krijgen vooral partnerzorg of andere vormen van informele zorg, terwijl anderen vooral gebruik maken van formele of particulier betaalde zorg. Dit kan bijdragen aan verschillen in welbevinden. Door Self-Determination Theory toe te passen op de zorgcontext, veronderstellen we dat typen zorgnetwerken verschillen in de mate waarin ze de gevoelens van verbondenheid, autonomie en competentie van de zorgontvanger bevorderen, wat verschillen in welbevinden van zorgontvangers in verschillende zorg netwerken zou kunnen verklaren. We gebruiken gegevens, afkomstig uit tien observaties van de Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (N= 18.434 observaties van 4.837 oudere Nederlandse volwassenen, van 1992 tot 2022), om dit te onderzoeken.  Zorgnetwerktypen zijn a priori samengesteld uit (voornamelijk) partner, informele, formele of particulier betaalde zorg.  Mixed-model regressieanalyse van depressieve symptomen als maat voor welbevinden wordt toegepast op zorgnetwerktype. Het ontvangen van zorg van een partner-zorgnetwerk draagt het meest bij aan het welbevinden. Degenen met een formeel zorgnetwerk zijn het slechtste af. Eenzaamheid en zorg toereikendheid verklaren deze verschillen gedeeltelijk.","Samenvatting: The results of the Dutch 2023 parliamentary elections sent shock waves around the world as the populist radical right, anti-Muslim, Party for Freedom, won by a large margin. This latest victory has left many Dutch Muslims wondering at their place in the Netherlands further eroding their already low trust in the Dutch government. Despite however the political salience of Islam in the Netherlands, little is still known about how the political participation of Muslims is informed by Islam, especially for those who have been socialized in Europe. \n This work investigates this relationship, through the analyses of 33 semi-structured interviews of 2nd and 3rd generation Turkish and Moroccan Dutch. Where there are a lot of similarities between those with a Moroccan and those with a Turkish background such as migration history and religion, there are many differences in terms of religious, ethnic and political organization. Furthermore, the practice of Islam is often gendered. Therefore how Islamic religiosity informs political participation may differ between ethnicity and between gender. Taking these things into consideration this study contributes to the current literature by asking the following question: How does Islamic religiosity inform the political participation of Turkish and Moroccan Dutch men and women who were socialized in the Netherlands? And how are these processes gendered and related to ethnicity? \n \n We approach Islamic religiosity from a multi-dimensional perspective shedding light on how religious practice (private and communal), beliefs and religious identity can differentially inform why and how individual Muslims participate. Results pertaining to group differences still to come.\n \n","Samenvatting: This paper explores the mechanisms through which emotional and attitudinal dispositions combined together translate into the political actions of “vote” (electoral participation) and “voice” (protest participation). We ask: how do emotions, in conjunction with political trust and political efficacy, lead to different forms of political participation? We conceptualize political trust and efficacy and their presumed effects on voting and protesting. We then turn to discuss the role of discrete emotions (anger, contempt, hope, anxiety) and the relationship between emotions and political participation. We particularly zoom in on the role of anger and contempt because we expect that, combined with citizens’ levels of efficacy and trust, their effects on political participation differ – the relationships depend on the type of participation (voting or protesting). We test those relationships separately for the respondents who are nested in three different ideological categories, namely left-wing, right-wing, and moderate citizens. We use a dataset of 6 different countries – Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Poland – to test our hypotheses in those different political contexts.","Samenvatting: Dit artikel onderzoekt hoe anti-institutionele groeperingen in Nederland zich verhouden tot het gevestigde politieke landschap op basis van 69 thematisch geanalyseerde nieuwsberichten van anti-institutionele nieuwswebsites en een casestudie: de negatieve reactie van de anti-institutionele nieuwswebsites op de recentelijke verkiezingsoverwinning van de PVV. Anti-institutioneel extremisme in Nederland is sinds 2023 gedefinieerd door de AIVD als een groepering van mensen die geloven dat er in Nederland en internationaal een kwaadaardige, ongedefinieerde elite aan de macht is die het onderdrukken van de gewone mens tot doel heeft. Net zoals bij populistische vijandbeelden is het narratief open qua invulling, thematiek en grieven, waardoor er een groot aantal verschillende grieven in kunnen worden ondergebracht.  \n \n Hoewel er overeenkomsten zijn tussen het anti-institutionele en het populistische narratief, en de PVV aan verschillende grieven raakt die vaak door de anti-institutionele organisaties worden geuit, sluit het milieu zich niet aan bij het populisme van de PVV. Bijna alle geanalyseerde organisaties wezen de PVV-overwinning in de afgelopen verkiezing bijna meteen af in meerderde gepubliceerde artikelen op hun websites. Dit komt gedeeltelijk doordat een verkiezingsoverwinning niet aansluit bij het narratief van onderdrukking. Hiernaast vinden anti-institutionele organisaties de PVV te mild op specifieke onderwerpen die zij belangrijk vinden, zoals vaccinatie en de Great Reset, en steunen zij overwegend Forum voor Democratie, dat wel actief tegemoetkomt aan deze specifieke grieven. Hoewel het vaak lijkt alsof anti-systeem narratieven niet specifiek zijn, door het groot aantal verschillende grieven dat erin is ondergebracht, zijn er in werkelijkheid grote verschillen tussen de verschillende stromingen. \n","Samenvatting: We introduce a new dataset examining the political behaviours and attitudes of Italian students approaching their first voting experience. Framed within the \"Schools\" work package of the POSTGEN project, we set out to investigate the initial attribution and definition of political meanings among secondary school students using a digitally administered survey that blends traditional and gamified elements to approximately 1,000 students from 20 secondary schools across different areas of the Italian territory. The dataset provides several information pertaining to diverse domains of sociology and political science. First, building on the framework of issue yield theory (De Sio & Weber, 2014), it gathers opinions on a wide range of important socioeconomic and sociocultural issues characterising the Italian public debate, including climate change attitudes, populist and stealth democratic attitudes, and attitudes towards sexism. Second, we leverage an innovative \"Swipe\" module to measure popularity/approval of a wide array of politicians and social media influencers, thereby minimizing survey fatigue and enabling data linkage between students' social media usage and influencers’ online activity. Third, we exploit the nested structure of the dataset by providing school-level contextual characteristics related to socioeconomic and political characteristics of districts. Employing a sampling strategy aimed at covering the different school-tracks of the Italian educational system and reaching students regardless of their political engagement, this dataset not only aims to enrich our understanding of youth political participation but also introduces an innovative data linkage strategy that will allow nuanced insights into social media behaviour and political engagement among young people.","Samenvatting: In het voortgezet onderwijs (vo) vormen docenten wat etnische achtergrond betreft geen afspiegeling van de leerling- en beroepsbevolking. Onderzoek laat zien dat diverse onderwijsteams van grote waarde zijn voor leerlingen en onderwijsprofessionals. Zo kan het gelijke kansen bevorderen. Wat zijn mogelijke verklaringen voor de ondervertegenwoordiging in het vo van docenten van kleur? En hoe kunnen scholen meer docenten van kleur aantrekken en ervoor zorgen dat zij zich thuis (blijven) voelen in het onderwijs? Voion, het arbeidsmarkt- en opleidingsfonds voor het voortgezet onderwijs, heeft kwalitatief onderzoek laten uitvoeren om deze vragen te beantwoorden. Uit interviews met 15 docenten van kleur die werkzaam zijn (of zijn geweest) in het voortgezet onderwijs komt een aantal thema’s naar voren die een rol spelen bij uitstroom. Hoge werkdruk is zo’n thema; docenten van kleur werken relatief vaak op scholen met een etnisch diverse leerlingpopulatie en met veel leerlingen met het risico op leerachterstanden. Dit stelt docenten voor extra uitdagingen. Andere thema’s zijn ongelijke behandeling van leerlingen van kleur en docenten van kleur en het ontbreken van structureel diversiteitsbeleid op de school. Aanbevelingen zijn dan ook het vergroten van ondersteuning, het ontwikkelen van een professionele aanspreekcultuur en aandacht voor vieringen uit andere culturen.","Samenvatting: Societal processes and public opinion can affect whether employers take action and which policy measures they choose to boost diversity, equal opportunities and inclusion, and to reduce discrimination in the workplace. Yet, public opinion regarding workplace diversity initiatives (other than affirmative action) has so far received little scholarly attention, especially in Europe. This study sheds light on public attitudes towards three different, commonly applied types of workplace diversity policies, and examines which individual-level and national-level conditions shape public support. We use large-scale, representative survey data from two pooled waves of the Eurobarometer, covering 38,009 citizens across 26 European countries. We enrich these data with information on national-level income inequality as well as countries’ labor market and antidiscrimination legislation and policies. Results show significant differences in public support across the three types of policies, with the strongest support for diversity training, followed closely by monitoring recruitment procedures, whereas support for monitoring workforce composition is clearly lower. This is in line with the idea that support tends to be lower for more preferential and prescriptive workplace policies. Furthermore, we find that, in addition to individual-level factors – particularly gender, ethnic minority group membership, personal experiences with discrimination, prejudice, intergroup contact and political orientation – national-level conditions are important antecedents of public support for workplace diversity policies. That is, differences in public attitudes regarding such policies are also shaped by country-level income inequalities, people’s perceptions of how widespread discrimination and unequal opportunities are in society, and national-level laws and policies to fight unequal opportunities.","Samenvatting: Levels of exclusion of ethno-religious immigrants among the majority population vary strongly across European countries. This study addresses the question whether these variations are related to differences in immigrant integration policies and welfare policies across Europe. We argue that both policies need to be considered simultaneously, given the development of integration policies within historical frameworks of pre-existing welfare regimes, and expect that policies may set intergroup norms discouraging exclusion of ethno-religious immigrants. Using data from the European Social Survey, enriched with information on immigrant integration policies and welfare policies related to the labour market, we only find a negative association between welcoming integration policies and ethno-religious exclusionism, yet not for more generous welfare policies. Additionally, we hypothesize that the relationship between governmental policies and exclusionism might be weaker for people in economic precarious positions as compared to their more privileged counterparts, because people in such precarious positions face more intergroup competition and perceive more intergroup threat. Our findings show that exposure to more welcoming integration policies is less strongly negatively associated with exclusion of ethno-religious immigrants for some economic precarious groups (i.e., for lowly educated and low income groups) but not for others (i.e., for unemployed people and those living under economic strain). Exposure to more generous welfare policies is unrelated with exclusion of ethno-religious immigrants for both people in precarious and non-precarious positions.","Samenvatting: Introduction: Poverty is often associated with social stigma and trauma, potentially shaping negative emotions. While research has focused primarily on shame in poverty, other emotions are often overlooked. Furthermore, shame is not static and can lead to additional negative emotions over time. As a result, emotions related to shame remain largely unexplored, potentially overlooking the full complexity of poverty-related emotions and their consequences. This has led to the following main research question How do emotions shaped by the experience of poverty change over the life course?\n Methods: 34 life story interviews were conducted with people who had experienced poverty at some point in their lives, using Wengraf's biographical narrative interpretation method. The interviews were analysed using Labov's narrative method with the help of an expert by experience. Theories from the sociology of emotions, including Turner, Scheff, and Hochschild, were borrowed to explore not only how emotions change, but also how emotions are shaped by interactions and the social structures to which emotions are attributed in the experience of poverty. Two composite narratives were created.\n Results: Analyses show that while poverty, mainly through interactions, initially evokes shame, over time the emotion evolves into (related) negative emotions such as anger, fear, and sadness, creating emotional traps. With this transformation, the direction of the emotions also changes, as shame, initially directed inward at the self, becomes frustration directed outward at social structures. This eventually leads to withdrawal from social structures such as support systems and society as a whole.\n","Samenvatting: This paper analyzes how the experience of beauty – that is, the aesthetic appreciation of physical appearance -- is shaped by race. The analysis is based on Q-sort interviews (Kuipers, 2015) with a stratified sample of 150 people from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK. The quantitative analysis of the Q-sort data clearly showed strongly racialized patterns that are surprisingly consistent across the five countries; and that did not always emerge clearly in the interview materials due to a taboo on race. The interviews show that beauty tastes are characterized by what Bonillo-Silva called “racialized emotions”: strongly affective responses to (the beauty of) differently racialized categories. In contrast with expectations derived from earlier, mostly American, research, informants on average found Black and Mediterranean men and women more beautiful than average, and Asian and Nordic men and women less so. The paper provides in-depth – and potentially rather discomforting – discussion of the racialized repertoires that come to the surface in these aesthetic experiences. These racialized emotions can be traced back to old historical roots: the European imperialist expansion that was legitimated by racial hierarchies, but also the formation of European nation-states that linked political and social rights and identities to common ancestry, which could be seen in specific national or ethnic ‘looks’. I conclude by pointing to the similarities between beauty and race: both are located in people’s physique, are imbued with emotions, and – to a large part because of the emotional power -- have a strong social presence and real consequences that are typically suppressed, ignored or downplayed.","Samenvatting: his study analyses how the doing of emotions is negotiated in sex advice media aimed at couples. It takes the case of Dutch reality series Sex Academy to explore how its display and discussion of feelings offers various cultural idea(l)s about enacting couple intimacy. Sex Academy follows a make-over format in which couples ‘boost’ their sex lives through advice sessions, workshops, and assignments. Typical of mainstream sex advice, it emphasises the importance of feelings of romance and sensuality in relationships, thus promoting feeling norms that foster heteronormative coupledom. Yet, existing studies rarely take into account how participants may not only reproduce but also challenge and contest such feeling norms. This study turns its focus to the interactions among partners and between participants and presenters to analyse how intimate feeling repertoires are negotiated. These feeling repertoires comprise a set of possible ways of expressing and experiencing emotions in committed relationships. This study argues that such an approach allows for a better understanding of the ways mainstream sex advice may consolidate but also challenge heteronormative notions of relationship intimacy.","Samenvatting: In Flanders, Belgium, the gap in school outcomes between monolingual majority youngsters and multilingual minoritized youngsters is among the highest in the OECD. In this presentation, we introduce the JEZ-to-Emotions project, which articulates a novel approach to understanding these educational gaps that centers on children’s emotional competence (EC) – i.e. the ability to perceive, understand and regulate emotions. We pay specific attention to the role that teachers play in shaping pupils’ EC. Although teachers increasingly recognize the importance of emotions in education, the potential bias in socializing EC at school remains largely overlooked. Based on insights from various scientific disciplines such as developmental and cultural psychology, sociology of language and education and linguistics, we argue that multilingual minoritized pupils may not equally benefit from teachers' emotion-related socialization behaviors (ERSBs) since their emotional experiences are inherently different from those of majority monolinguals due to their engagement in multiple languages ànd cultural contexts. As such, teachers’ well-intended practices to foster EC may actually reinforce ethnic and linguistic gaps that plague education. In this presentation, we will review the state-of-the-art leading up three research objectives that could lead to future ERSBs promoting EC in all children: (1) explore what multilingual pupils understand by EC, (2) identify how multilingual minoritized pupils’ EC, perceived ERSBs of teachers and school outcomes are related, and (3) identify which conditions improve teachers’ effectiveness as socialization agents of multilingual minoritized pupils’ EC.","Samenvatting: Qualitative methods are a set of data collection and analytic strategies that cohere around a shared emphasis on the interpretive and meaning-laden aspects of social life, including emotional experiences and social behavior in work settings. Attending to meaning-making in real settings among actual interactants promises to offer “rich rigor” and contextualized information about emotions in the workplace deemed salient and important to workers themselves (Tracy, 2010). In our review of qualitative studies into emotional labour and regulation, we take Hochschild’s (1983) now classic work on the commercialization of feelings in the context of the airline industry as a starting point. Hochschild provided a sociological look at how corporations increasingly encroach on worker feelings and sense of self in order to maximize corporate gains. Some research that builds on Hochschild’s work can reduce her analysis to individual strategies without appreciating the wider context of mid-century American capitalism in which her analysis is embedded. This lack of context is partly a methodological artifact, as quantitative analyses that reduce emotional labor to one variable among many are, by their nature, susceptible to overlooking the broader sociological conditions in which emotion management processes take place. Qualitative studies of emotional labor and emotion regulation in the workplace are thus critical for continuing to contextualize these processes, reassess their salience and forms in a variety of jobs, and consider how diverse workers, through labor revitalization and/or social media, might resist feelings rules, alienation, and the commercialization of feelings. We summarize core qualitative methods for data collection and analysis in emotional labor research, including ethnographic, interview, and focus group data collection methods, as well as grounded theory and abductive analytic approaches, and give directions for future qualitative research on emotional labour.","Samenvatting: While harassment awareness trainings centering on mechanisms of male domination are an effective tool for advancing gender equality, this approach is not universally adopted. Deciphering what leads policymakers and professionals to employ feminist vocabularies and gender-based perspectives is important for our scholarly understanding of how policy solutions come about, and for practitioners championing gender equality policy. Based on an interview-based and ethnographic study of anti-street harassment trainings by the Dutch organization Qpido, this article analyzes an understudied and undertheorized source of obstruction to the use of feminist knowledge and gender-based vocabularies in policy: professionals’ and policymakers’ apprehension of moralizing. During interviews and meetings in which they discussed what sort of tone and angle should be employed in awareness trainings on street harassment, policymakers and professionals in Amsterdam explained they wanted to avoid messages that were “too confrontational” in favor of campaigns that “incite discussion.” I draw from emotion scholarship to conceptualize this apprehension as a moral emotion characterized by anxiety about inappropriately imposing a moral judgment or attitude. Considering apprehension of moralizing contributes to our understanding of why policymakers and professionals avoid feminist vocabularies pertaining to structural gender inequalities, in favor of more individual-oriented policies on sexual violence—a shift that occurred in the Netherlands and other national contexts. The article discusses the concept’s applicability to other national contexts and types of social relations and its broader scientific and political implications.","Samenvatting: Succesvolle arbeidsmarktintegratie van statushouders (vluchtelingen met een verblijfsvergunning) vraagt inzet en aanpassing van nieuwkomers, gemeenten en werkgevers. De Inburgeringswet bepaalt dat statushouders o.a. taalcursussen en het inburgeringsexamen doen. Gemeenten ontwikkelen beleid om statushouders aan het werk te helpen, bijvoorbeeld via opleidingstrajecten en werkervaringsplaatsen. Toch blijft de arbeidsmarktparticipatie van statushouders in Nederland, en vooral in het Noorden, achter. \n \n Naast welbekende oorzaken zoals taalachterstanden wijst onderzoek uit dat werkgevers contracten vaak niet verlengen omdat statushouders niet goed ‘passen’. Dit kan komen door een gebrekkige ‘person-job’ en/of ‘person-organization fit'. De oorzaken hiervoor worden vaak gezocht aan de kant van de statushouder, terwijl deze ook bij de werkgever kunnen liggen of de gemeentelijke professional die de statushouder naar werk bemiddelt.\n \n In dit paper ligt de nadruk op de rol van gemeentelijke professionals als cruciale schakel in de bemiddeling van statushouders naar werk. We beschrijven een transdisciplinair project dat beoogt bij te dragen aan de duurzame en passende arbeidsmarktparticipatie van statushouders door het faciliteren van een goede ‘match’ tussen statushouder en werkgever. Dit doen wij in co-creatie met werkgevers, gemeenten en statushouders in de arbeidsmarktregio Groningen en Noord-Drenthe. \n \n We presenteren het ‘statushouder-werkgever-fit model’ en beargumenteren het belang van een realistisch tolerantie perspectief daarin op basis van psychologische en sociologische theorie, een literatuurscan, een vragenlijst onder professionals en focusgroepen met statushouders, werkgevers en professionals. We beschrijven vervolgens de ontwikkeling en inhoud van twee evidence-and theory-based interventies voor gemeentelijke professionals - een training en toolbox - en hoe we hun effect monitoren en evalueren en aanpassingen doen.","Samenvatting: Sinds de Russische invasie van Oekraïne hebben miljoenen Oekraïners hun toevlucht gezocht in Europa, van wie meer dan honderdduizend in Nederland. Voor deze Oekraïense vluchtelingen is de nooit eerder gebruikte Europese Richtlijn Tijdelijke Bescherming (RTB) geactiveerd. Onder de Nederlandse implementatie van de RTB zijn Oekraïners onderworpen aan beleid dat omschreven kan worden als ‘work first’, met directe toegang tot de arbeidsmarkt zonder inburgeringsplicht. Dit wijkt af van de reguliere ‘settle first’ benadering voor andere vluchtelingengroepen die na een opvangperiode en statusverlening een verplicht inburgeringstraject moeten volgen. Deze afwijkende beleidscondities creëren de unieke mogelijkheid om de impact van ‘work first’ ten opzichte van ‘settle first’ beleid op de arbeidsmarktpositie van vluchtelingen te onderzoeken. In dit proefschriftvoorstel stel ik vergelijkingen tussen verschillende vluchtelingengroepen in verschillende contexten voor om hier grip op te krijgen. Deze vergelijkingen omvatten naast Oekraïners ten opzichte van Syriërs in Nederland, ook Oekraïners in Nederland ten opzichte van dezelfde groep in Duitsland. Voor deze vergelijkingen maak ik gebruik van grootschalige representatieve longitudinale survey data, verzameld door een consortium van het WODC, CBS, EUR en RIVM. Voor de vergelijking met Oekraïners in Duitsland wordt vergelijkbare longitudinale IAB-BAMF-SOEP data geanalyseerd. Naast deze comparatieve studies stel ik een een mixed methods studie voor die zich richt op Oekraïners met een meer kwetsbare arbeidsmarktpositie in Nederland. Op deze wijze hoop ik met mijn proefschrift bij te dragen aan kennis rondom startposities en vroege ontwikkelingen in de arbeidsmarktpositie van vluchtelingen, en in het bijzonder, welke rol beleid hierin speelt.","Samenvatting: In januari 2022 trad de nieuwe Wet inburgering in werking, als reactie op tekortkomingen uit de vorige wet. Binnen deze nieuwe wet kregen gemeenten opnieuw de verantwoordelijkheid voor het aanbod en de monitoring van de inburgeringstrajecten voor nieuwkomers. Om beter aan te sluiten bij de capaciteiten en behoeften van nieuwkomers zijn er voortaan bovendien drie verschillende ‘routes’ naar inburgering (B1, Z- en onderwijs-route). De wet is ingestoken als ‘lerend en adaptief stelsel’. Uit eerder onderzoek weten we dat beleid een rol kan spelen in de positieverwerving van nieuwkomers, met name binnen de eerste periode na aankomst, is het van belang de werking van dit nieuwe beleid te evalueren. Tegen die achtergrond doen we in Rotterdam vier jaar lang onderzoek naar de opzet, uitvoering en resultaten van het nieuwe inburgeringsbeleid.Kwalitatief onderzoek onder betrokkenen toont algemene steun voor het nieuwe beleid. Tegelijkertijd werden naast opstartproblemen ook meer structurele knelpunten gesignaleerd. We constateerden dat de werelden van opvang en integratie nog steeds te veel van elkaar gescheiden zijn, en de vraag rijst of de inburgering niet te ingewikkeld is geworden door de vele ‘stations’ die nieuwkomers nu moeten passeren. Ook zijn er zorgen over het verschil in beleid voor gezinsmigranten en de rol van (arbeidsmarkt)participatie binnen en naast de inburgering. Deze knelpunten vragen aandacht van de nationale en lokale overheden, maar bieden ook aanknopingspunten voor het bestuderen en verbeteren van (inburgerings)beleid in andere landen.","Samenvatting: Oorlog, conflict, geweld en vervolging dwingen mensen hun thuis te ontvluchten en zich in nieuwe maatschappijen te vestigen. Hoe bouwen vluchtelingen hun leven opnieuw op? Hebben zij invloed op dit proces, zijn zij vrij om te beslissen hoe hun leven vorm krijgt, en spelen andere contextuele factoren een rol? Terwijl veel bekend is over de maatschappelijke posities van vluchtelingen en de factoren die hun integratie beïnvloeden, weten we minder over welke aspiraties   vluchtelingen zelf hebben en hoe deze een rol spelen bij het vinden van een plek in hun nieuwe maatschappij. \nOm deze kenniskloof aan te pakken, wordt er etnografisch onderzoek gedaan naar de vestigingsprocessen van statushouders in Rotterdam. We volgen een groep van ongeveer 15 statushouders van begin tot het einde van hun inburgeringstraject. Hierin kijken we naar in hoeverre het statushouders lukt om hun eigen aspiraties te realiseren en welke rol het inburgeringsbeleid van Rotterdam speelt hierin.","Samenvatting: Statushouders benadrukken het belang van het beheersen van de Nederlandse taal voor hun integratie in de samenleving. Het is een sleutel tot werk, sociale contacten en een zelfstandig bestaan. In deze studie gaan we bij Syrische statushouders na welke factoren de ontwikkeling in de Nederlandse taalbeheersing beïnvloeden. We hebben daarbij aandacht voor het inburgerings- en opvangbeleid en individuele factoren. Het Nederlandse inburgeringsbeleid staat voor een belangrijk deel in het teken van het leren van de Nederlandse taal. Ons onderzoek kan inzicht geven of het streven naar een hoger taalniveau in de inburgering op termijn tot een gunstigere ontwikkeling leidt in de Nederlandse taalverwerving. Naast het inburgeringsbeleid richten we ons op de relatie tussen het opvangbeleid en taalverwerving. Er loopt al enige tijd een discussie over aanpassingen in het opvangbeleid, waarin meer mogelijkheden voor het leren van de Nederlandse taal en participatie zijn voorzien. In deze studie willen we nagaan in hoeverre kenmerken van het opvangbeleid van betekenis zijn voor ontwikkelingen in de taalverwerving. Voor beide beleidsfactoren zijn we geïnteresseerd in de werking op de korte en op de wat langere termijn. Eerder onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat het afronden van de inburgering en het kunnen participeren in de opvang bijdraagt aan de Nederlandse taalverwerving, maar het is niet duidelijk in hoeverre de effecten van deze factoren zich opstapelen of juist afvlakken. Verder onderzoeken we verschillende achtergrondkenmerken, omdat eerder onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat oudere mensen en degenen met lagere opleidingsniveaus doorgaans meer moeite hebben om hogere niveaus van taalvaardigheid te bereiken","Samenvatting: Stadsvergroening staat in de spotlight, en wordt gezien als hefboom voor een groene, gezonde, veerkrachtige en sociale stad. Er is een groeiend besef van de positieve effecten van groen in de stad op duurzaamheid en klimaatadaptatie, (mentale) gezondheid en welzijn en sociale contacten en netwerken in de stad.\n Naast een groeiend besef en gevoel van urgentie over het belang van stadsnatuur, groeit ook het bewustzijn dat toegang tot en betrokkenheid bij stadsnatuur ongelijk verdeeld is. Wetenschappers noemen bijvoorbeeld het risico op ‘green exclusivity’ en ‘green gentrification’ en ook natuurorganisaties en lokale overheden spreken steeds vaker over ‘groene kansenongelijkheid’. Het is dus belangrijk om een inclusiever beeld te krijgen van wat stadsnatuur voor verschillende groepen betekent en hoe ze erbij kunnen worden betrokken. \n \n In een actiegericht en multi-method promotieproject met lokale gemeenschappen en beleidsmakers onderzoek ik de veranderingen die nodig zijn op weg naar een groene, gezonde leefomgeving voor en door iedereen. Daarbij combineer ik inzichten uit de sociologie, governance en public health. \n \n In het eerste gedeelte van het onderzoek staan de inwoners van Rotterdam-Zuid centraal. Hoe kijken zij naar de stadsvergroening en stadsvergroeningsinitiatieven? Wat vinden ze belangrijk, waar is behoefte aan en waarom? Hoe zijn inwoners betrokken bij bestaande initiatieven, welke drempels ervaren ze en wat is er nodig voor inclusieve community-based initiatieven?\n \n In deze sessie deel ik de onderzoeksplannen en ga ik graag in gesprek over de beoogde onderzoeksvragen, methoden en het theoretisch kader.\n \n Auteur: Marije van der Kruk\n Department of Public Administration and Sociology, Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences \n","Samenvatting: Advances in digital technologies are transforming how European cities are managed, planned and governed. Urban Digital Twins (UDTs), or technologies aimed at virtually replicating cities, are hailed for their potential to enhance the efficiency of management processes. Cities across Europe increasingly invest in digital infrastructures like UDTs in the expectation that such technologies enable us to see, experience and interact with the urban environment in new and exciting ways. \n Scholarly attempts to grasp the significance of this emerging phenomenon are hampered by technical determinism and techno-optimism. Existing literature on UDTs tends to overly focus on definitional questions while offering a rather descriptive account of applications that ignores potential tensions or conflicts. In this paper, we circumvent these pitfalls by combining insights from urban sociology, STS and political science to shed new light on UDTs as ‘incipient regimes of visibility’. \n By tracing the development of UDTs in Rotterdam and The Hague, we investigate how UDTs constitute a virtual order of things that determines which urban processes, spaces, experiences, and communities ‘count’ – or are left unaccounted for – in the digital representation of city life. Based on extensive qualitative research, we show that the meaning of UDTs is volatile and context-dependent, that technological and socio-technological challenges hamper their development and implementation, and that bureaucrats’ internal and external expectations diverge. Extending the lessons learned, we argue that UDTs are still ambiguous as incipient regimes of visibility and that ‘future thinking’ about UDTs needs to coincide with critical thinking about questions of inclusivity and participation. \n \n Keywords: Urban Digital Twins, Smart Urbanism, Visibility, Digitalization, Urban Sociology\n \n","Samenvatting: Despite ongoing discussions about the benefits of women in the leadership of work organizations, there exists little quantifiable evidence to what degree female managers’ presence benefits workers’ well-being. Recent qualitative evidence suggests that female managers are more supportive of work-family balance than male managers (van Hek & van der Lippe, 2022). The central research question of this study is: \n To what extent does the increase in the relative number of female managers in small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) lead to a lower prevalence of long-term sick leave among employees?\n \n In short, our argumentation is that female managers are associated with less mental-health related sickness absence because of support for work-family balance due to managers’ own experiences with work-family conflict. We therefore expect a negative association between female managers and mental-health related long-term sickness absence among employees, especially when: employees are female and new and single parents, when female managers have children themselves and in small organizations (more direct link between managers and employees).\n \n We employ an innovative study design using linked employer-employee longitudinal population microdata from the Netherlands. This overcomes major limitations of surveys in studying work & health (e.g. selection, response, and social desirability biases). Using linked data, we investigate how female managers in SME organizations (Dutch: MKB) impact the incidence of mental-health-related long-term sickness absence among employees. We employ dynamic workplace panel analyses to establish a causal effect and explore heterogeneities along employee gender & parenthood of employees, parenthood of managers, and organization size. \n","Samenvatting: There is a growing scholarly interest in the pivotal role that employer policies play in shaping social inequality. Particularly, employer orientation (EO), i.e. how employers combine wage policy and the use of non-standard employment (NSE), may influence social disparities as they influence inequalities regarding job security and income. Previous empirical research on employer policies has mostly focused on either wage policy or the use of NSE. Research on how employers combine this is mostly theoretical. These studies usually distinguish between two types of orientations: external and internal. Externally oriented entities base their policies on the fluctuating dynamics of supply and demand within the labour market, and often use NSE and performance-based wages. Internally oriented firms more often use permanent contracts and offer their employees a continuously increasing wage based on administrative rules such as wage scales. \n \n To our knowledge, this study is the first to empirically investigate how employers combine wage policy and the use of NSE. To do so, we use register data on employment from Statistics Netherlands linked to the structure of earnings survey. Since employer orientation is a multi-dimensional concept, we employ Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to cluster employers with similar orientations. Using LCA enables us to explore ways in which employers combine wage policy and the use of NSE beyond the two types that are commonly distinguished in the theoretical literature. In addition, we explore how firm size, sector, whether a firm is a multinational, and labour union activity influence a firm’s EO.","Samenvatting: A growing body of research has shown that employee turnover behavior can be contagious and spreads within workplaces. This could induce turnover spirals that result in increased workloads, loss of control, and discontent for remaining employees. Yet, research on the impact of co-worker and manager behaviors on employee turnover is novel and knowledge on underlying social processes remains narrow. To detect, prevent and manage situations in which multiple employees might leave at once, this article examines effects of co-worker and manager behaviors on employee job searches, as this is the first instance in which employees engage in turnover processes  This paper is novel as it uses a multilevel data structure to move beyond individual antecedents of job searches and by examining which type of co-workers and which type of behaviors -i.e., several types of turnover behaviors and counterproductive work behaviors- are most likely to induce employee job searches. Moreover, so far existing research only assesses the impact of co-worker and manager behavior in one or two organizations, making this study a more comprehensive test of behavioral contagion mechanisms in turnover processes. Unique employer-employee linked data was collected and is now being prepared for analysis. The authors expect to present a first draft with preliminary findings at the Dag van de Sociologie.","Samenvatting: Een grote meerderheid van de Nederlanders ervaart hun werk als betekenisvol. Vanuit de ‘public service motivation’ gedachte is werk betekenisvol wanneer het werk bijdraagt aan het welzijn van anderen (Perry & Wise, 1990; Steijn, 2006). Het ervaren van werk als betekenisvol is echter niet volledig afhankelijk van de mogelijke maatschappelijke meerwaarde ervan. Lips-Wiersma en Wright (2012) vatten het subjectieve concept betekenisvol werk met de ´comprehensive meaningful work scale’ samen in vier dimensies. Deze dimensies zijn: trouw zijn aan jezelf (zingeving die ontstaat wanneer we in of tijdens ons werk dicht bij onze persoonlijke kernwaarden blijven), eenheid met anderen (zingeving die ontstaat wanneer we in of tijdens ons werk verbonden voelen met collega’s), volledig potentieel benutten (zingeving die ontstaat wanneer we in of tijdens on werk unieke en specifieke talenten en vaardigheden ontwikkelen en inzetten), en anderen dienen (zingeving die ontstaat wanneer we in of tijdens ons werk het verschil het leven van anderen kunnen maken). Arbeidsociologisch onderzoek laat zien dat er verschillen bestaan tussen beroepsgroepen in het ervaren van betekenisvol werk (Lips-Wiersma et al, 2016; De Prins et al, 2018; Van der Aa, Van Rijn en Brinkman, 2024). Recent stellen Van der Aa, Van Rijn en Brinkman (2024) dat het ervaren van betekenisvol werk in hogere mate afhangt van de kwaliteit van arbeid (het geheel van arbeidsomstandigheden, arbeidsinhoud, arbeidsverhoudingen en arbeidsvoorwaarden) dan de bedrijfstak waarin iemand werkt. Het is voor leidinggevenden, besturen en hr-professionals belangrijk te beseffen dat goede arbeidsvoorwaarden, goede arbeidsverhoudingen, het geven van feedback, duidelijkheid in het werk, afwisseling en uitdaging in het werk belangrijke aanjagers zijn voor het ervaren van betekenisvol werk. Dit onderzoek bouwt voort op het onderzoek van Van der Aa et al, (2024) en beoogt meer inzicht te krijgen in de invloed van levensopvattingen (ook wel culturele predisposities) op het ervaren van werk als betekenisvol. Hierbij onderzoeken we de impact van hoe mensen in het leven staan op het verband tussen de kwaliteit van arbeid en betekenisvol werk. Voor de uitvoering van dit onderzoek maken we gebruik van surveydata, welke in het voorjaar van 2023 zijn verzameld door middel van een online vragenlijst onder panelleden van het NIPObase-panel van Kantar. Aan de hand van cluster- en regressieanalyse worden de hypothesen getoetst.","Samenvatting: Er zijn grote tekorten op de arbeidsmarkt. Eén van de mogelijke oplossingen daarvoor is dat deeltijders meer uren gaan werken. Het programma Meer uren werkt!, gefinancierd door het Nationaal Groeifonds, onderzoekt en implementeert interventies om dat mogelijk te maken. Het programma richt zich op diverse drempels in de manier waarop werk georganiseerd is, in de sociale omgeving van deeltijders en bij de opvattingen en situatie van deeltijders zelf. In deze bijdrage onderzoeken we welke drempels vooral van belang zijn.\n \n We doen dat met een vignetexperiment, welke onderdeel is van de derde meting van de Sustainable Workforce Survey. Werknemers kregen 4 situaties te zien waarin zij gevraagd werden of ze in die specifieke situatie meer uren zouden willen werken. We nemen daarbij mee op welke manier de extra te werken uren gepland gaan worden, welke taken werknemers dan zullen verrichten, wat meer werken financieel oplevert en hoe veel anderen in de omgeving van deeltijders werken. Ook controleren we voor een aantal achtergrondkenmerken zoals gender en leeftijd die gemeten zijn in de survey.\n \n De voorlopige resultaten laten zien dat vooral het financiële aspect meespeelt: wanneer werknemers er financieel op achteruit gaan door meer uren te werken willen zij dat niet, en wanneer ze er op vooruit gaan juist wel. Ook het zelf kunnen plannen van de extra uren en het krijgen van extra taken zijn belangrijke redenen voor deeltijders om meer te willen werken. De sociale omgeving speelt geen rol in deze beslissing.","Samenvatting: Most research on the careers of employees in non-standard employment (NSE) have focused on contract type and on whether employees in NSE experience a stepping-stone scenario (transitioning to a permanent contract) or a trap scenario (remaining in NSE). These studies neglect other dimensions of employment and how these different dimensions interact and cluster over the course of careers. The present study uses the multi-dimensional concept of employment precariousness (EP) to investigate the early careers of employees in NSE. Using yearly data from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel, we studied the first five years of the careers of Dutch employees who entered the labour market after having left formal education between 2008 to 2018 (N=307). EP was measured with the employment precariousness scale Europe (EPRES-E), which distinguishes five dimensions of EP: temporariness, vulnerability, disempowerment, wages and unpredictability of working times. We used mixture Hidden Markov models (MHMM) to identify ‘states’ that represent different combinations of these dimensions and thus different levels of precariousness. In addition, we studied how employees moved between these states and how this mobility is influenced by both gender and educational level. We found five states of EP and three patterns of transitioning between these states (trajectories). We distinguish between the following three trajectories: towards precariousness, towards a standard employment relationship (SER) and towards low pay and inactivity. Our research does not provide evidence for either the steppingstone or the entrapment hypothesis.","Samenvatting: There is a general contention that work has become increasingly precarious across Europe since the 1970s. However, conclusions about the trend of precarisation are based on a fragmented body of literature which has lacked a multidimensional, longitudinal, comparative perspective of precarious employment. As a result, nuances of the trend and the empirical ground on which the conclusions are based remain unclear. Empirical enquiry into precarious employment needs a multidimensional view, because contractual insecurity is not the only way precariousness is induced in employment. The longitudinal and comparative perspective are essential in empirical studies if we want to understand when, where and how the different dimensions of precarious employment developed across Europe. Additionally, this enables us to interpret differences in trends of precarious employment in relation to the country-specific institutional context. Therefore, this paper integrates these three aspects and describes the development of six dimensions of precarious employment (low wages, temporariness, disempowerment, unfavourable working time arrangements, lack of training, and lack of rights) across Europe. Using a hierarchical cluster analysis, we identify different trends in indicators of precarious employment. Preliminary results show we cannot identify a general trend of precarisation across dimensions of precarious employment, rather, trends vary depending on the dimension and country cluster. The results help us to assess when, where and how precarisation occurs in Europe, and can inform European-level and national-level policy about the most critical trends and their time- and institutional contexts, allowing for targeted interventions.","Samenvatting: About 15% of Dutch employees works on a fixed-term contract (FTC). We aim to study how (changing) labour market institutions, in particular employment protection legislation, affect the likelihood of upward mobility for these employees. The Netherlands is an interesting case, since institutional change occurred in July 2015 when the Wet Werk en Zekerheid was implemented, and because employers and employees can deviate from the law in collective bargaining agreements (CBAs).  \n Previous research has shown that in dualized labour markets, i.e. labour markets with few restrictions on the use of FTCs and strict protection of permanent contracts, upward mobility is less likely. The 2015 legislative change aimed to reduce dualization on the Dutch labour market and thereby to stimulate upward mobility among employees on FTCs.\n We studied employment quality, i.e. contract type and income, of employees who entered the labour market on a FTC in 2009 and compared it to employees who entered in 2015. We use monthly register data and mixture hidden Markov models to identify employment quality states and to study how employees move between these states in a period of 48 months. We analyzed differences between the 2009 and 2015 cohort as well as the extent to which CBAs influence movement between states.\n We identified six employment trajectories that represented different patterns of movement between the eight states of employment quality we identified. The 2009 cohort was overrepresented in trajectories ending in inactivity and the 2015 cohort in the trajectory that represented a stepping-stone scenario.","Samenvatting: This paper examines school-to-work transitions and early career differences in the Netherlands and Italy, focusing on gender and educational differences. Rather than examining isolated transitions between employment states, we use 5-year trajectories to identify differences in the likelihood of experiencing stable and protected early careers. While both countries have high rates of temporary employment among young people, Italy's high youth unemployment rates and difficult school-to-work transitions contrast with the more favorable context in the Netherlands. We use register data from Statistics Netherlands, which provides detailed information on employment, contract type, and earnings, as well as a unique dataset from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). This dataset combines administrative records on employment and income with survey data, providing insights into the socio-demographic characteristics of individuals. Using a Mixture Hidden Markov Model, we estimate error-corrected early career trajectories characterized by different degrees of employment stability. By treating \"employment quality\" as a latent variable, we simultaneously examine changes in employment status, contract type, and earnings, providing a comprehensive view of differences in early career trajectories as opposed to focusing solely on the transition from temporary to permanent employment. Finally, we examine whether less educated youth and women are more likely to experience trajectories characterized by instability and weak labor market attachment.","Samenvatting: Due to weakly enforced regulations on statutory minimum wages and income protections for domestic workers, households play a decisive role in setting domestic workers’ wages. The absence of clear and enforceable wage-standards is frequently forwarded as an explanation for why domestic workers’ wages tend to be lower and less secure than those of workers in other occupational fields. In this paper, we aim to explain wage differences within the sector for domestic work, as the lack of wage-standards may also give rise to considerable variation in the wages paid by different households. Specifically, we hypothesize on the extent to which the height and security of wages are dependent on characteristics of households (such as economic resources and time pressures), domestic workers (such as ethnicity and age) and qualities of the relationship between the two (such as years of service and frequency of contact). Our analyses draw on primary data from 2023 on households from the Dutch LISS panel that hire a domestic worker (N=422). We operationalize the height of payments as the price paid for one hour of cleaning. The security of payments is measured by asking households if they continue payments when cleaning appointments are cancelled due to illness or holidays. In addition to descriptive analyses, OLS and logistic regression techniques are used to test the hypotheses regarding the height and security of domestic workers’ wages. The paper concludes with policy implications.","Samenvatting: Unemployment insurance, disability insurance and social assistance, are benefit schemes that are vital in individuals' transitions from and to employment. While the majority of all recipients are on benefits only for a short time, the majority at any given time consist of long-term or recurring recipients. The causes of structural benefit recipiency are however poorly understood. One potential mechanism is a negative feedback loop of social capital and benefit recipiency. Many studies have explored the impact of social capital on employment. Furthermore, research on unemployment scarring indicates the existence of a negative effect of benefit recipiency on social capital. Following these two schools of thought, we expect a reciprocal relationship between social capital and benefit recipiency.\n \n Examining a sample of 3,774 individuals and 21,234 person-year observations between 2007 and 2019 from linked survey (LISS panel) and Dutch register data, we employ random-intercept cross-lagged panel models in a structural equation modelling framework to investigate the reciprocal relationship of social capital and benefit recipiency. These data allow us to identify short benefit recipiency spells, which are often missed in similar research, consider individuals' history of benefit recipiency before our observation window and examine non-claimants, i.e. individuals that are eligible for social assistance but do not receive any benefits. Preliminary results indicate that benefit recipiency lowers social capital but that social capital does not affect benefit recipiency. These findings could have important implications for our theoretical understanding of the relationship between social capital and benefit recipiency.\n","Samenvatting: Previous research demonstrates that the education people obtain influences their entire working trajectories. One crucial characteristic of education here is specificity – the amount of general or job-specific skills that students obtain. While educational specificity has been shown to give a relative advantage in the early career (earnings and employment), in the later career, this advantage turns into a disadvantage. This pattern is also called the late-career penalty. To date, we still know little about why the late-career penalty exists. While previous research has mainly focused on the side of the employee, in this paper, we turn to the side of the employer, asking: How do hiring agents evaluate general and specific degrees in the early and late career? We thus want to understand whether and how employers take a part in influencing the trajectories of general and specific graduates. \n \n To address this question, we conduct a factorial survey experiment with people who hire for jobs in Software Development and HRM in Germany and England. This means that we look at countries with contrasting education systems and labour market structures and at professions that differ in how they are subjected to technological change. The survey experiment will allow us to disentangle how the different degrees are evaluated in the early and late career, how the level of education, participation in training, career mobility, and the applicants’ gender matter in these evaluations, and how these evaluations are grounded in institutions.","Samenvatting: Despite long-term trends towards desegregation of the labour market, police organizations remain male-dominated, only due to lower recruitment, but also due to higher attrition of women. This is problematic, considering that attrition is costly and that higher representation of women is associated with better policing outcomes and police legitimacy. Attrition of women in policing is often attributed to the gendered nature of police organizations and remaining societal gender inequalities. However, these effects are often not explicitly studied, and even in settings known for their relatively high gender equality, such as Norway, attrition is higher. Using monthly employment register data of the full working population of the Netherlands, this study aims to compare attrition rates of Dutch female police officers to those of their male counterparts and their female peers in other (male-dominated) organizations. The latter enables us to not only describe gender differences, but also to study to what extent these are unique to policing, or rather reflect masculine-organizational or societal factors, as have been described in general literature on gender in organizations. Using this unique approach, this study hopes to inform efforts to retain more women in policing, both in the Netherlands, as well as in other countries. At the Dag van de Sociologie, we will present preliminary results of this study.","Samenvatting: In recent decades, retirement has undergone a significant transformation, with an increasing number of people engaging in bridge employment, a phenomenon where retirees keep working while receiving pension income. Despite growing interest in understanding the determinants of bridge employment, existing research has focused on factors at a single time point close to retirement in single-country contexts. Therefore, it has remained unclear how barriers and facilitators to bridge employment are shaped across the life course in different countries. To address these gaps, we pose two research questions: (1) to what extent do financial resources and health mediate the relationship between work-family trajectories and bridge employment? and (2) to what extent does the relationship between these mediators and bridge employment depend on the generosity of a country's pension and healthcare system? To answer these questions, we integrate insights from cumulative (dis)advantage theory and welfare state theory. Using individual-level data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe and country-level data from Eurostat, we employ multilevel analysis within the structural equation modeling framework, enabling us to dissect direct, indirect, and conditional indirect pathways from work-family trajectories to bridge employment across 26 countries. Preliminary findings indicate that compared to full-time working partnered parents, those who were mostly divorced, part-time employed, and self-employed over the life course are more likely to work in retirement, whereas those being single, childless, and non-employed are less likely to do so. Further analyses will be performed to decompose direct, indirect, and conditional indirect effects in these relationships."]},{"id":"ronde","name":"ronde","type":"numeric","minWidth":60,"align":"left"},{"id":"sessie","name":"sessie","type":"character"},{"id":"zaal","name":"zaal","type":"character","style":[{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#7D9FCA"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"},{"background":"#8F9559"}]},{"id":"auteur","name":"auteur","type":"character"},{"id":"coauteurs","name":"coauteurs","type":"character"},{"id":"taal","name":"taal","type":"character"},{"id":"titel","name":"titel","type":"character","minWidth":200},{"id":"samenvatting","name":"samenvatting","type":"character","show":false}],"filterable":true,"searchable":true,"defaultPageSize":10,"showPageSizeOptions":true,"pageSizeOptions":[4,10,50,100,200],"showPagination":true,"onClick":"expand","highlight":true,"rowStyle":{"cursor":"pointer"},"dataKey":"ad6b5d573a14ec17306bdd28d7a0a4dc"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
