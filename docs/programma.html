Despite global efforts to prevent street harassment, little attention has been given to the role of youth professionals—those working daily with youth at the neighbourhood or street level—in addressing this issue. Youth professionals build long-term relationships with youth, promoting youth’s self-confidence, sense of belonging and pro-social behaviour, making them uniquely positioned to contribute to the prevention of street harassment.\r\nThis study explores how youth professionals in Rotterdam (opbouwend en grensstellend jongerenwerk) engage with youth (aged 12-24) who (may) participate in street harassment. By applying an inductive data analysis on semi-structured interviews with n=28 youth professionals, it aims to understand how youth professionals make sense of youths’ involvement in street harassment, and how this shapes the way they address such behaviour. \r\nPreliminary findings indicate that youth professionals perceive street harassment behaviour as part of young people’s sexual development and boundary exploration. Although they most notably cite peer pressure and social-media shaped social norms as key drivers of this behaviour, their strategies to address it primarily focus on fostering perspective-taking and empathy in one-on-one interactions. Yet, they acknowledge the limits of this approach, as peer pressure – reinforced by group dynamics – often overrides individual perspectives and intentions. Our findings suggest that it is essential to equip youth professionals with easy-to-use tools for preventing street harassment applicable in a group setting, building on existing group dynamics.","Gebaseerd op etnografisch onderzoek presenteren we drie manieren waarop jongeren hun geweld van betekenis voorzien. Ten eerste zeggen zij dat overweldigd raken door blinde woede en niet meer voor rede vatbaar zijn. Jongeren zeggen echter ook dat zij sterke gevoelens van angst, spanning en boosheid proberen te verbergen of te veranderen door hun houding en manier van bewegen aan te passen en dat ze de emoties van de ander proberen te lezen. In dit tweede patroon koppelen ze de beheersing van emoties aan effectief geweldsgebruik. In het derde patroon ligt de nadruk op het vermogen om voortdurend oog te houden voor de mogelijkheden en beperkingen die ontstaan in de situatie, de handelingsopties die daaraan verbonden zijn en het inschatten van de handelingsopties van de ander. In deze verhalen komen emoties nauwelijks ter sprake. We menen dat deze patronen waarheden lijken te verbergen. In het eerste patroon appelleren jongeren aan een breder gedeeld idee over de ontoerekeningsvatbaarheid van emoties en plaatsen zij hun geweld buiten zichzelf. Dit verhult echter dat zij ook geweld gebruiken omdat ze er zich toe aangetrokken voelen en omdat ze het nodig achten. Het tweede patroon wordt alleen gebezigd door jongeren met een langdurige geschiedenis van geweld en een levensloop gekenmerkt door afwijzing: door ouders, op school en werk. De nadruk op het vermogen om geweldsituaties te beheersen verhult de machteloosheid waarmee zij in de rest van hun leven te kampen hebben.","Bystanders play a crucial role in regulating public violence. In street fights, robberies, partner violence, and police violence, intervention is common, though its frequency, timing, and form vary. Video-based research shows that bystander actions depend on violence severity and perceived perpetrator motivations, suggesting that specific patterns prompt intervention. This paper explores interactional patterns in an underexamined form of violence: vigilante violence. Unlike other violent encounters, vigilante violence is often seen as legitimate, placing bystanders in a different role. Using 35 video-recorded incidents from public space cameras in Cape Town, South Africa, we analyze how often bystanders intervene, when they act, and how they do so. Findings show a high frequency of intervention, mainly occurring when violence becomes excessive. The most common intervention methods involve distracting the perpetrator and physically protecting the victim. Rather than stopping violence entirely, in vigilante violence bystanders aim to regulate it. This study highlights the nuanced role of bystanders across illegitimate and legitimate violence, and the need for more detailed understanding of the interactional patterns that drive intervention.","Although harassment awareness training is identified as an effective tool to prevent gender-based violence, the reception of many of these programs is mixed. This article seeks to explain why responses to street harassment awareness training were much more antagonistic among female students of color in schools in disadvantaged areas than among mostly white girls in schools in more affluent areas. It draws from scholarship that examines the reception of policy and training programs through qualitative methods. The study is based on ethnographic observations of thirteen training sessions conducted by France’s leading anti-street harassment organization, Stop harcèlement de rue, as well as interviews with students, trainers, and high school staff. The findings show we cannot attribute differences in the reception of street harassment awareness-raising only to girls’ adherence or opposition to feminist values. Instead, this article shows how girls’ intersectional identities (in terms of race and class) informed to what extent seeing themselves as victims of street harassment conflicted with other dimensions of their identity. Popular media stereotypes about street harassment as a crime mainly committed by racialized minority men made it hard for racialized minority girls to blame perpetrators without feeling they were “betraying” their male peers. Girls in schools in more affluent areas, most of which were white, could denounce street harassment without feeling they were putting the blame on their male classmates. Based on these findings, the article questions whether raising awareness on street harassment rather than gender-based violence more broadly, is an effective prevention strategy.","This study examines leisure and cultural participation patterns and profiles in Flanders using theories of cultural capital, social stratification, cultural omnivorousness and voraciousness. The research addresses questions about stability and change in participation profiles from 2004 to 2021, incorporating a focus on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using latent class analysis, we identified clusters based on participation in out-of-home cultural and broader leisure activities. Data were sourced from the Participation survey across multiple years (2004-2021). Four participation profiles emerged from 2004 to 2020: \"stay-at-homes,\" \"heritage and museum visitors,\" \"cultural browsers,\" and \"culture enthusiasts,\" distinguished by their levels and types of engagement. In 2020-2021, the profiles expanded to five, incorporating pandemic-specific leisure adaptations such as increased reliance on family-based and socially-oriented activities. Cultural omnivores and voracious participants exhibited shifts towards alternative activities due to limited access to cultural venues during the pandemic. Findings confirm the persistent role of social stratification in participation patterns, with higher education, urban living, and cultural socialisation predicting greater engagement. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the resilience of broader participation profiles, while also illustrating temporary shifts in leisure patterns, raising questions about post-pandemic trends. This study contributes to policy development by offering insights into barriers to cultural participation and the need for equitable access, especially for lower-educated, rural, and economically disadvantaged populations. It underscores the importance of fostering cultural capital and accessibility in shaping inclusive cultural and leisure policies.","Cultural capital is thought to mark boundaries between groups and therefore changes in cultural participation are expected to lead to the formation of new social networks, in particular among upwardly mobile social groups (DiMaggio, 1982, 1987). Building further on empirical studies by Meuleman (2021), Lizardo (2006), Edelmann & Vaisy (2014), the research question of this paper reads: To what extent does cultural capital acquired in adulthood affect the social status of the social network? \r\nI will make use of data of the Dutch LISS (Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences) panel administered by Centerdata (Tilburg University, The Netherlands). The LISS panel is based on a random sample from the Dutch population among members of households aged 16 and older, with an initial response rate of 48%. The 7500 members of the panel (in 5000 households) are surveyed over a period of 14 years, annually about their cultural participation and their social networks. \r\nTo analyze these data, a combination is used of crossed-lagged panel models and fixed effects models, that combine the advantages of the two models (Allison, Williams & Moral Benito, 2017). Preliminary analyses in Stata on a 50% sample of the data set using the first four waves show different results between the cross-lagged effect models and models that control for unobserved heterogeneity. New analyses will be carried out for the presentation of the paper.\r\n\r\n","The number of individuals who identify as 'spiritual' has grown significantly in Western Europe, but so far it remains unclear what spirituality entails and who these spiritual people are. Many scholars regard spirituality as a coherent worldview with common practices, specifically pocketed towards higher-educated individuals. Yet several findings hint at the existence of distinct spiritual subgroups, as reflected in varying spiritual preferences that seem to depend on educational level. With this study, we aim to explore whether this internal diversity within the spiritual milieu indeed exists, and if so, whether spirituality has become a new way for the higher-educated to distance themselves from the lower-educated. We will conduct a latent-class analysis with nationally representative Dutch LISS data (2009) that captures a great variety of spiritual beliefs, practices and experiences, allowing us to unravel distinct spiritual profiles. In a second step, we will employ regression analyses to examine whether these spiritual profiles are linked to educational level. All in all, this approach enables us to explore whether spiritual preferences have become a new form of capital distinguishing the higher-educated from the lower-educated in The Netherlands.","What is the value of culture? While this question is often discussed in economic or artistic terms, it is clear that the social value of culture and cultural participation is equally significant. This study is part of a series of reports on the value of culture (economic, social, health-related and cognitive) and focuses on the social value of culture. In this study, the social value of culture is examined through a systematic literature review conducted on 95 peer-reviewed articles that were published between 2010 and 2024. Five key aspects were identified: social capital, social skills, social cohesion, social inclusion, and local image/community. The findings indicate that cultural consumption strengthens social capital, where bonding and bridging capital enhance social networks and mutual resources. Cultural consumption contributes to the development of social skills, such as communication, empathy, and cooperation, particularly among younger age groups and various socially vulnerable groups. Additionally, social cohesion is fostered through shared cultural experiences, which promote trust and collaboration within and between groups. Social inclusion is enhanced as cultural consumption reduces social isolation and increases the engagement of marginalized groups in society. Furthermore, culture plays a role in strengthening local image, identity, and community development. This study highlights that culture (and cultural consumption) makes a crucial social contribution, making it relevant beyond the cultural and artistic domains themselves. In the conclusion of the paper, we identify key research gaps concerning the social value of culture.","Morele en politieke vraagstukken lijken de laatste 10 tot 15 jaar een steeds grotere impact te hebben op de waardering van kunst en cultuur. Door verschillende maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen worden culturele uitingen steeds vaker beoordeeld – en ook veroordeeld – om inhoudelijke redenen die te maken hebben met progressieve waardes. Denk aan kritiek op racistische stereotypen, de mannelijke blik op vrouwen, culturele toe-eigening, et cetera. Hoewel – grofweg sinds de negentiende eeuw – aan de relatief autonome kant van het artistieke veld esthetische oordelen waardevoller worden geacht dan ethische (Bourdieu), wordt dit dogma steeds meer ter discussie gesteld. \r\nVeel van deze kritiek wordt geuit op sociale media, maar heeft ook impact in het artistieke veld zelf. Mijn presentatie focust op de weerslag van deze ontwikkelingen in professionele recensies, ‘poortwachters’ in het veld. Recensenten zijn bemiddelaars tussen maker en publiek en medebepalen artistieke waarde. Ze weerspiegelen én vormen discoursen rond kunst. \r\nDe casus zijn filmrecensies in Nederlandse reguliere media (wellicht in een later stadium uit te breiden, zowel naar culturele discipline als geografisch). Door middel van een inhoudsanalyse van een selectie van recensies uit de afgelopen decennia wil ik achterhalen of er daadwerkelijk een verschuiving heeft plaatsgevonden in de balans tussen esthetische en ethische oordelen. Interviews met hedendaagse recensenten voegen hier de blik van de betrokkenen aan toe: hoe reflecteren zij op hun oordelen in het verleden en heden? Aangezien het empirisch onderzoek op moment van indienen nog moet plaatsvinden, kan ik in dit abstract nog geen bevindingen benoemen.\r\n","In recent years, energy poverty has received significant attention in the public debate. Its prevalence and depth have been well documented, but less is known about the experiences of people living in energy poverty and those who try to assist them. This paper builds on theatre-based workshops that brought together people living in energy poverty and professionals who aim to support them. This project explored the meaning of living in energy poverty, strategies to deal with higher energy prices, and the interactions between professionals and clients. Results show that people in energy poverty do not experience it as a distinct form of poverty. The interactions between professionals and clients similarly did not reflect specific-energy poverty-related issues – although energy was often the reason for initiating contact. Rather, what mattered to clients was sensitive communication and feeling heard. For social workers, the workshops offered lessons in the experiences of being approached by professionals. This paper concludes that, in terms of energy poverty, it is important to pay attention to the price of energy and energy sufficiency of households; policy should not single it out but rather integrate it into structural poverty alleviation policy, including home improvement and income support. In terms of interactions, it concludes that mutual support, patience, and a lack of judgment are essential for successful social engagement. In terms of methods, theatre methods reveal deep-felt experiences of poverty and social-work interactions and provide immediate learning for service providers and clients.","Transgender individuals worldwide face complex challenges, including limited access to healthcare, structural exclusion, and pervasive transphobia. However, a predominant problem-driven focus in research and media often amplifies these issues, overshadowing other vital aspects of trans identities, such as desires, joy, and community-building. This paper adopts a desire-driven approach (Tuck, 2009) to explore how healthcare and overall wellbeing for transgender youth in The Hague, The Netherlands, can be improved. Using Community-Led Research and Action (CLRA), an innovative and co-creative anthropological method, five transgender youth conducted research within their own communities. Through traditional qualitative methods, such as interviews, and creative expression through art, this study highlights the experiences, aspirations, and needs of trans youth. Key themes emerging from the research include access to care, the importance of community, and the celebration of trans joy. Our research revealed practical and systemic barriers, including a pressing need for improved access to counseling led by peers with lived experience and a stronger presence of trans professionals in healthcare. Additionally, participants expressed a desire for accessible social spaces tailored to their needs and emphasized the value of informal networks for sharing knowledge and support. Financial assistance was also identified as critical, with participants struggling to access resources necessary for gender-affirming care and daily living. By centering trans youth as knowledge producers, this study contributes to creating a more inclusive care system and a narrative that values the full complexity of trans identities.","Kwalitatief onderzoek naar de ervaringen en perspectieven van moeilijk bereikbare groepen, zoals anderstalige nieuwkomers of sociaal gemarginaliseerde gemeenschappen, wordt vaak gehinderd door methodologische uitdagingen. Traditionele interviewtechnieken, die sterk afhankelijk zijn van taal, schieten tekort in het blootleggen van de complexiteit en gelaagdheid van hun leefwereld. Dit resulteert niet alleen in wetenschappelijke blinde vlekken, maar draagt ook bij aan de structurele ondervertegenwoordiging van deze groepen in academisch en beleidsmatig onderzoek.\r\nDit onderzoek introduceert Illustration Elicitation, een innovatieve methode die gebruikmaakt van visuele stimuli—specifiek ontworpen illustratiekaarten— als middel om de stem van participanten te versterken en om hen in staat te stellen hun ervaringen op een toegankelijke en betekenisvolle manier te verwoorden. Door semigestructureerde interviews te combineren met de illustratiekaarten, biedt deze benadering een methodologisch kader dat toelaat taalbarrières te overbruggen, complexere narratieven te ontsluiten en diepere inzichten te verschaffen.\r\nDe eerste empirische toepassing van deze methode richt zich op OKAN-leerlingen (onthaalklassen voor anderstalige nieuwkomers). De centrale onderzoeksvraag richt zich op de mogelijkheden en beperkingen die jongeren ervaren binnen de context van hun vrijetijdsbeleving en cultuureducatie in Vlaanderen.\r\nIllustration Elicitation wordt gepositioneerd binnen de traditie van de visuele sociologie en steunt op Bourdieu’s theorie van cultureel kapitaal. De methode functioneert niet alleen als een instrument om communicatiebarrières te overbruggen, maar maakt deel uit van een bredere paradigmaverschuiving binnen sociaalwetenschappelijk onderzoek.\r\nDeze benadering problematiseert structurele en symbolische uitsluitingsmechanismen die de sociaal-culturele participatie van gemarginaliseerde jongeren beperken. Het onderzoek stelt dat Illustration Elicitation niet slechts een alternatief is voor conventionele methoden, maar een noodzakelijke uitbreiding binnen kwalitatief onderzoek.\r\nDeze studie bespreekt de theoretische en praktische implicaties van deze methode, reflecteert op de kansen en beperkingen en pleit voor een herdefiniëring van onderzoekstradities waarin visuele methoden niet langer als louter complementair worden beschouwd, maar fundamenteel bijdragen aan de representatie en erkenning van gemarginaliseerde stemmen.\r\n\r\n","It is becoming increasingly common for researchers to study social phenomena from an interpersonal perspective, using data gathered from a round-robin design, in which each member of a group (e.g., a nuclear family, classroom, or team of employees) provides data about every other member. For example, each student in a classroom can indicate how much they like each other student. Dyadic data from this design have a complex underlying structure because each dyad is cross-nested within both members, given that each of N members provides information about N − 1 members, as well as having information provided about them by N − 1 members. The social relations model (SRM) was designed to decompose interpersonal perceptions (or behaviors) into random effects associated with perceivers (or actors), targets (or partners), and the uniqueness of particular relationships. The primary outcomes of an SRM analysis involve the estimated covariance matrices at the personal level (individual differences in actor and partner effects, and how they are correlated within persons) and the dyad level (e.g., how relationship-specific behaviors differ across dyads, given person-level effects). Thus, it is conceptually possible to model complex associations among multiple round-robin variables by fitting a structural equation model (SEM) to model the covariance structure at one or both levels of interest. This presentation will showcase an in-progress R package that facilitates a 2-step approach: (1) estimating a multivariate SRM using MCMC estimation and (2) using the lavaan package to fit an SEM with ML estimation.","Bayesian methods have been gaining popularity in a variety of areas of research, leading to methodological advancements in areas such as Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM). The Bayesian framework can be useful in experimental psychology, can improve estimation with small samples, can identify unknown change-points in genetic studies, or can evaluate measurement invariance in a more flexible way. User-friendly software, such as the R package blavaan have improved accessibility to advanced Bayesian methods. Here we will present some analysis that can be done with the package blavaan. Such as Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and Structural Equation Models (SEM). These can be model with continuous or categorical indicators. We will present a case study, as a workflow example. Building a Bayesian measurement model, evaluating global and local model fit, selection of priors, adding predictors, and compare models. This way we will present a the application of Bayesian SEM in an open-source package, and how this can be extended.","Latent Class Analysis (LCA) is a widely used method in social science research for identifying unobserved subgroups in a population. However, the computational speed of conducting LCA remains a significant challenge, especially with large datasets and complex models. In these scenarios, a single analysis may take hours or days to converge using commercial software, and even longer with some open-source alternatives. The latent package is an open-source R solution that addresses these shortcomings by providing fast C++ implementations of the LCA equations and optimization techniques. It also supports parallel computations of these optimization algorithms, offering even greater speed when models are prone to local minima and require multiple starting values to identify the global minimum. In summary, latent is designed to efficiently handle large-scale datasets and complex models, making it an ideal choice both for applied researchers needing rapid, scalable solutions and for methodologists conducting large-scale simulations. This presentation will highlight the package's performance in accelerating LCA estimation, demonstrating its ability to deliver results in seconds rather than minutes or hours, and showcasing its potential for both large-scale simulation studies and real-world applications.","As ethnic diversity increases in Western countries, concerns about negative outgroup attitudes and interethnic polarization are growing. In diverse classrooms, interacting processes such as peer influence, homophily, and attitude-based friend selection contribute to changing outgroup attitudes. This study explores if and when individual attitude shifts driven by these processes might scale up to intergroup hostility in empirical multiethnic school cohorts that initially have a rather positive interethnic climate. Using an agent-based model calibrated with longitudinal network and attitude data, we conduct a series of computational experiments to assess the effects of hypothetical macro-level shocks, such as violent incidents or inflammatory political speeches. Leveraging publicly available data from the “Friendship and Identity in Schools” project, we examine secondary school cohorts in a diverse German region. As a baseline, we use a model fitted to longitudinal data on the co-evolution of intergroup attitudes and friendship relations in two different school cohorts. Then, we use the empirically calibrated model as a simulation tool to evaluate longer-term consequences of effects external shocks could have on the relative strength of social influence on outgroup attitudes and on ethnic homophily in friendship selection. Our findings indicate that peer influence, when intensified by an external shock, can over time magnify even small outgroup biases, leading to affective polarization. This dynamic is accelerated under strong ethnic homophily. We further provide a detailed analysis of how these results emerge from the empirical context and the interacting processes included in the model.","When operating as interviewers, Large Language Models have great potential in enriching data collection on opinions, values and attitudes common in social scientific study. Instead of asking a survey question with fixed response categories, individual attitudes can be collected at scale while allowing for the nuance and conversation characteristic of qualitative interviews. These ‘chatbot interviews’ can be easily integrated into existing survey designs, yielding both representative and in-depth information. When combined with text analysis techniques (e.g. topic modeling), chatbot interviews have the potential to resolve “the trade-off between depth and scale” (Wuttke et al. 2024:1) that has plagued opinion studies for decades. While there is much to be done to establish such a new method for data collection, we break the ice by  (a) comparing the performance of chatbot interviewers to human (student) interviewers and (b) evaluating the theoretical sensitivity of chatbot interviewers. Using the open-source Python package boterviewer. developed to conduct chatbot interviews and experiment with prompts, we set up an interview experiment on a convenience sample of 27 university students and staff. We provide the model with a short questionnaire on Universal Basic Income, vary conditions with and without a short background on deservingness theory. Based on both a qualitative content analysis and quantitative text-analytical metrics, we compare the theoretical relevance of follow-up questions, the sensitivity to theoretical cues, and the effectiveness in eliciting theoretically relevant answers. First (very) preliminary results suggest that theory prompts indeed improve the theoretical relevance of follow-up questions asked by chatbot interviewers. Further analysis of the data still have to be performed.","Territorial stigma has intensified in the past decades due to economic shifts, spatial segregation, stigmatizing policies, populist politics, and media portrayals. Newspaper media play a dominant role in (re)producing and circulating negative representations of neighborhoods. This study will focus on the Bijlmer, one of the most well-known and ‘notorious’ areas in the Netherlands. The aim of this study is to show how the Bijlmer is portrayed in newspaper media, how these representations change across time and what might explain these changes. Theoretical perspectives on urban change and media systems are both included. A large corpus is build including articles on the Bijlmer from the five largest newspapers between 1990-2024. Quantitative methods (computational text analysis) and qualitative methods (content analysis) are used to analyze this corpus. This presentation will focus on the work in progress, outlining some of the potential benefits and challenges relating to corpus building and textual analysis. Ultimately, the study aims to unravel how and why areas become (de)stigmatized.","Social norms are often thought to emerge because they benefit those who follow them. Yet, the persistence of  “unpopular norms”—behavioral regularities that endure despite being privately rejected by most—challenges this assumption. Examples include foot binding in historical China, child marriage, and entrenched patterns of bribery and corruption. How can we explain the emergence of such norms?\r\nWe argue that the structure of social networks plays a crucial role in the emergence of unpopular norms by magnifying the “majority illusion” paradox. Even when a behavior is globally rare, certain network structures can cause individuals to perceive that most of their neighbors conform to it, creating the false impression that it is more widespread than it truly is. This illusion, when coupled with network externalities, can ripple through the network, pushing the population toward widespread compliance with an unpopular norm. \r\nOur agent-based simulations reveal that network structure not only magnifies this illusion but also facilitates its spread under conditions of incomplete information and simplified decision-making heuristics. While most network configurations allow the majority to resist the spread of an unpopular norm pushed by a few fanatics, specific structures—characterized by fat-tailed degree distributions, disassortative mixing, and strong degree-trait correlation—enable these fanatics to sway the majority into compliance.\r\nTo empirically validate this mechanism, we conduct a large-scale incentivized social network experiment involving an asymmetric coordination game on experimentally manipulated networks. I will present the simulation results, describe the experimental design, and—if data is available by then—discuss the experimental findings.","Gender inequality in scientific careers has been documented in a variety of outcomes including access to professor positions, career length, scientific impact, and productivity. Much less is known about the careers of scholars who leave academia at some point. This is an important knowledge gap, since the majority of those who obtain a PhD will not keep working in academia. Furthermore, women PhDs leave the university at higher rates than men, and while this has thus far been assumed to be a negative outcome, the (gendered) effects of this transition out of academia are understudied. The consequences of transitions later in the career are especially unknown. Our paper addresses this knowledge gap by studying the salary development of men and women PhDs over a period up to 17 years. To do so, we use survey data from 21,350 individuals who obtained doctorate at universities in the Netherlands, linked to Dutch register data on salaries, job characteristics and family composition. Because we have access to detailed information about doctoral recipients’ jobs, we are able to pinpoint the transition out of academia and analyse its impact on salary trajectories. We further enrich our findings by testing whether different push and pull factors (i.e. temporary employment, work hours, having a young child, disciplinary background) can help to explain why men and women’s salaries may develop differently following a transition out of academia. Consequently, we provide a detailed but nuanced account of gender inequality in researchers’ careers beyond academia in the Netherlands.","The expansion of administrative and big data and the increase in the survey's non-responses have highlighted the relevance of assessing the quality of non-probability samples. To tackle this issue, people usually resort to the Total Error (TE) framework, which divides the error into a measurement and a representation component. Extensive literature focuses on measurement error, often using a combination of data from different sources to evaluate whether the observed variables adequately capture the concept intended to be measured. Another branch of the literature has centered on the representation error, assessing how respondents are selected in the sample, leading to systematic differences between the population and the observed units. However, research modeling both of these components simultaneously is still scant. In the present study, we address this gap by jointly modeling the measurement and the representation errors, combining recent advances in both areas. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate our TE model under different specifications of measurement and representation errors. Additionally, we performed a case study analysis using a combination of Italian administrative registers and the Labor Force Survey (LFS) to evaluate the TE in the income variable. Our preliminary results show that our model adequately captures the different error sources and provides a good strategy for assessing the TE when using a combination of probability and non-probability data.","There exists great heterogeneity regarding both the definition and the operationalization of employment precariousness (EP) in the current literature. Due to the lack of consensus on what EP entails, there is an unfulfilled need for a universally recognized definition and operationalization of EP.  Consquently, authors use operationalizations based on available data. The literature on EP can be roughly divided into two approaches: one of which relates to the objective contractual arrangement (objective EP) and the other to an individual’s experience (subjective EP). However, it remains unclear how theoretically and data-driven definitions of EP, align with user-generated discussion of EP ‘in the wild’. In this study, we analyze discourse on BlueSky to explore how prevalent user-generated topics related to EP compare with both objective and subjective conceptualizations of EP. We apply Bi-term Topic modeling on user-generated data from BlueSky to identify a number of k latent employment-related topics. Our preliminary results demonstrate that the dimensions in the EPRES scale are not in alignment with the topics regarding EP discussed in online discourse","Digital trace data are increasingly used across the social and behavioral sciences. They allow researchers to access large volumes of highly detailed and continuous information, often in real-time. Such scale and speed can not be achieved when using traditional sources, such as surveys. Digital traces are also believed to overcome some of the limitations that surveys are criticized for. However, while the use of digital traces undoubtedly presents researchers with new possibilities, it also introduces new quality challenges that have been increasingly acknowledged in recent years. Accounting for these limitations is crucial, as they can lead to biased results and incorrect research findings. Therefore, in this paper, we apply hidden Markov models (HMMs) to digital trace data on Facebook use to assess the nature and incidence of error in measures of Facebook use frequency. HMMs are an attractive method that allows for the estimation and correction of error without the availability of (error-free) gold-standard data. Our results suggest that the measures derived from digital trace data severely underestimate the frequency of Facebook use for a third of our sample, in particular when not all relevant devices are tracked.","The substudy within the ENGINE project we will propose evaluates the effects of diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) policies of higher education institutions (HEIs) on promoting an inclusive diversity climate. Previous studies have shown that\r\nsuch a climate makes a crucial contribution to narrowing the ethnic gap. The two disconnected research strands on the effectiveness of institutional DEI policies have very different traditions and evaluation approaches. Critical race and\r\ndiversity studies tend to be skeptical about the positive effects of current DEI policies in HEIs (Campion et al., 2021; Ahmed, 2006; Bhopal 2020) whereas social psychology and organizational studies are more optimistic. To evaluate the\r\neffects of DEI policies on reducing the ethnic gap we need to 1) better understand the contributions of different types of policies and their different contexts, and 2) explore the relationship between DEI policies and diversity climates.\r\nIn the first phase of this research, the existing formal DEI-policies in Flemish HEIs will be described and categorized. In a later phase, different types of DEI policies will also be correlated with the results of a survey of students on diversity\r\nclimates and the ethnic gap. At later stages, we will also describe and explain contextual factors for successful implementation of good practices and inquire into possibilities of successful policy transfer.\r\nDuring the conference session, the first phase of the research will be presented. Here, the methodology used, and the preliminary findings will be explained. In addition, an overview of the next steps within the research process will be presented","A more inclusive diversity environment requires lecturers to create inclusive learning environments. Academic research shows that when teachers adjust their attitudes and teaching methods to respond to diversity, ethnic minority students\r\nachieve better academic results and develop higher levels of belonging (Florian, 2015; Wah & Nasri, 2019). Most studies on inclusive teaching practices and lecturer professionalization focus on compulsory education and have been conducted in\r\nAnglo-Saxon contexts. However, little is known about this in continental Europe and higher education institutions. Therefore, there is an urgent need for research on the effectiveness of professionalization to strengthen the inclusive skills of higher education lecturers. This contributes to the development of strategies for a more inclusive educational landscape and a better understanding of how different types of lecturer professionalization can contribute to this. A trajectory was established with various stakeholders following the principles of educational design research (Reeves et al., 2011) to develop a professionalization program for higher education teachers. The core of the program focuses on promoting cultural awareness, cultural knowledge and intercultural skills to better equip lecturers for a super-diverse educational context. The program consists of two modules: in module 1, the focus is on understanding diversity in their classroom practices, their own positionality and frames of references. In module 2, we focus on teaching how to effectively manage diversity in their teaching practices and interactions. During this session, the first draft of the professionalization program will be presented. Participants are invited to actively think about further development and implementation.","The increasing ethnic-cultural diversity in higher education has been accompanied by a rise in the formation of ethnic minority student organizations (EMSOs) on campus. While previous research has demonstrated that student organizations may contribute to the overall wellbeing and sense of belonging of higher education students on campus, their potential to reduce the ethnic gap remains understudied, particularly in the European context. This presentation reports on the initial findings from participatory action research conducted with 4 EMSOs operating within Flemish higher education institutions. The research seeks to examine the impact of EMSOS on ethnic inequality by (1) describing, explaining and measuring the influence of a variety of EMSOs, and (2) assessing the effectiveness of their activities in addressing the ethnic gap. By observing and collaborating with these organizations, this study sheds light on their capacity to support ethnic minority students and challenge systemic inequalities.","Student organizations in higher education institutions (HEIs) are significant agents of socialization. They play a pivotal role in shaping students’ academic, social, and civic experiences, as well as their identity construction as young adults. This\r\npresentation shares the initial survey findings from the Engaged4Equality project, which investigates ethno-racialized students’ perceptions, choices, and motivations regarding their (non-)membership in various types of student organizations,\r\nincluding socio-cultural groups, political groups, identity-oriented organizations, and program-oriented organizations. We are particularly interested in understanding how their membership - or lack thereof- in these organizations influences\r\nand mediates students’ academic and social inclusion within higher education. By exploring the factors that drive their decisions, the presentation seeks to uncover the barriers and opportunities that shape participation in student organizations\r\nand their role in fostering inclusive campus environments.","This paper seeks to explore interactions between the parents’ and child protection services, in the years after family reunion. Initial research suggests that parents experience ‘being lost in translation’ in multiple ways. Parents’ report that they do not understand what is happening at the time of the intervention, that it takes time for them to realize what the problem is in their family and how this is evaluated (differently) by authorities and professionals. Parents that reunited their families after years of being separated, struggle with questions on how they could have prevented intervention, how they can heal what is broken, and how they can realize a stable family life.\r\nThis paper is informed by a small pilot study that emerged out of a collaboration between the authors with experts and intercultural mediators from the Dutch- Eritrean community. This enabled a participatory action research design, project  that that resulted in narrative interviews with four Eritrean migrant parents and 4 intercultural mediators that assisted these and other parents in their interaction with (child protection) authorities.  \r\nIn this paper we problematize deficit-oriented approaches towards refugee parenting in recently reunited families. We argue the need for a) a better understanding of how parenting in recently reunited families is situated in the context of Dutch and Eritrean parenting practices, 2) the complexities and precarities in family systems in the context of rupture, instability and change, 3) the challenges that these families (parents and children) are experiencing in integrating and finding stability in The Netherlands. Finally, we explore what a better understanding of parents’ and children’s hopes and aspirations for the future can offer for transforming violence and instability in the context of the challenges that recently reunited families experience.          \r\n","Global migratory flows have revealed both the reluctance of host societies to accept these movements and the increasing tendency for human displacement, as the factors driving people to migrate have also broadened. While early studies on migration predominantly focused on its causes and the agency of individuals in seeking improved socioeconomic conditions, contemporary research increasingly acknowledges the influence of structural determinants pushing migration, including armed conflicts and the adverse effects of climate change. Building on this premise, the present study shifts the analytical focus towards host societies. From this perspective, immigrant integration raises questions about social cohesion in host societies when migrants arrive. In this context, religious affiliation can become a significant indicator of belonging in contemporary societies, as studies have shown the role of religious institutions in fostering these connections. However, religiosity can positively and negatively affect attitudes toward migrants, depending on the religious beliefs and the context. \r\nAccordingly, this study aims to provide new insights into the relationship between religion, migration, and social cohesion by investigating the role of religiosity and religious affiliation in fostering social trust among nationals and migrants in Chile, a topic that has been poorly researched by the Chilean academy. It hypothesizes that Chileans who identify as Catholic or Evangelical will, on average, show higher levels of social trust—one dimension of social cohesion—toward migrants.","This research examines how the perception of religiosity across three generations influences attitudes towards the “other” in Turkey, specifically Alevis, homosexuals, and Syrian immigrants. The study uses a qualitative approach, with semi-structured interviews conducted with 30 individuals from 10 families, representing three generations of the same family. The aim is to understand how different generations perceive religiosity and how these perceptions shape their views on the \"other.\". The first and second generations view religiosity as fulfilling formal religious obligations, whereas the third generation interprets it through moral and social values. A more rigid interpretation of religion correlates with a more distant attitude towards the \"other.\" While the first and second generations prefer to maintain a certain distance from Alevis and even do not consider them Muslims, the third generation is indifferent to whether someone is Alevi or not. Most first and second-generation participants expressed hesitation towards having a gay neighbor or colleague, justifying their views with religious reasoning. In contrast, some third-generation participants, unlike their families, view homosexuality as a natural process and would not be bothered by having a gay neighbor or colleague. These differences in perspective on the \"other\" are notably evident even within the same family. The first generation interprets helping them more as a religious responsibility, while the third generation expresses that they would do so simply because they are human. Additionally, the third generation complains about the large number of Syrians in the country although they do not exclude them because of their race","A generative line of inquiry, among the array of studies that the concept of ‘superdiversity’ has inspired, has been to investigate the micro-politics of encounters with social differences in everyday spaces of cities. The insight that ‘the everyday’ is an important domain in which social power is renewed and resisted has been used to analyze the development of solidarities between social groups and fault lines between them. This paper advances this everyday approach to superdiversity studies by bringing it in dialogue with the framework of ‘social aesthetics’. It argues that the lens of social aesthetics brings into view two related ways in which the aesthetic dimensions of superdiversity operates in the everyday city: 1) as a mode of organizing ethnicities in relation to whiteness, and 2) as sensorial judgements about national cultural identity. To develop these arguments, this paper draws on participant observation in a dense mixed-use space in Rotterdam – a site which includes a high-rise apartment complex, a busy train station, a high-end indoor food hall and a bi-weekly outdoor farmers’ market – and in-depth ethnographic interviews with residents and users of this space. The framework of social aesthetics allows everyday studies of superdiversity to move beyond a singular focus on the two social outcomes of majority-minority cities – does superdiversity increase or hinder solidarity? – to conceptualize superdiversity as a lived aesthetic category that mediates the relationship between city and nation.","There is a growing need to understand how increasing diversity affects urban life. Little attention is however given to new towns, such as Almere. After the three largest cities, Almere is the most diverse in the Netherlands, yet unlike those older cities, there is much less segregation and inequality. The research was conducted with interviews (50 interviewees) and a survey (more than 700 respondents) and builds on a previous study. The results focus on social position and diversity. The practical middle class, the largest socio-economic group in Almere, remains vulnerable to changes in the labour market but often manages to adapt. Young people experience barriers to entering the housing market. The share of skilled migrants and labour migrants is increasing. The neighbourhoods are becoming more diverse, and more households are sharing houses that were originally built as single-family dwellings. \r\nDespite concerns about neighbourhood deterioration and safety, residents appreciate the green surroundings, the existing social networks, and a perceived individual freedom of living. Residents of different backgrounds but similar social positions respect each other and give each other space. Casual, uncomplicated interaction characterises everyday diversity. These qualities remain largely obscured. New towns are famous for polarization, but political opinion seems to form largely outside of the context of daily life in the streets. Moreover, local governments put their problems first in the battle for government funding. And regrettably, prejudice about the planned design of new towns hides their social qualities from view.\r\n","De afgelopen jaren heeft de groeiende etnische en religieuze diversiteit in West-Europese steden, waaronder Belgische grootsteden, aanzienlijke uitdagingen blootgelegd in het voldoen aan de begrafeniswensen van religieuze minderheidsgroepen, in het bijzonder moslims. Hoewel de afgelopen decennia geleidelijk aan meer mogelijkheden zijn ontwikkelend voor religieuze minderheden om (gedeeltelijk) in overeenstemming met hun religieuze voorschriften begraven te worden, bestaan er nog steeds aanzienlijke juridische en praktische obstakels waarmee moslims geconfronteerd worden. De afwezigheid van eeuwige grafrust wordt beschouwd als een belangrijke redenen waarom veel moslims kiezen voor repatriëring naar hun (islamitisch) land van herkomst, maar ook familiebanden, sociale uitsluiting en ervaringen met discriminatie spelen een rol in de beslissing. Tegelijkertijd suggereren verschillende bronnen een afname van het aantal repatriëringen, wat duidt op een groeiende behoefte aan lokale begraafplaatsen voor moslims.\r\nDit onderzoek analyseert de funeraire behoeften van moslims in Vlaanderen en de uitdagingen die hiermee gepaard gaan voor de uitvaartsector. Centraal staan de volgende vragen: Wat zijn de begrafenisnoden van moslims in Vlaanderen? Welke uitdagingen ervaren zij en de betrokken actoren in de uitvaartsector? Op welke manieren spelen verschillende stakeholders hier al dan niet op in? In deze presentatie bespreek ik de preliminaire bevindingen op basis van diepte-interviews met verschillende professionals uit de uitvaartsector, zoals (moslim)begrafenisondernemers, begraafplaatsbeheerders en non-profitorganisaties. Ik bespreek de uitdagingen die ervaren worden door de verschillende professionals en belicht de spanningen rond de creatie en zichtbaarheid van begraafperken voor moslims. Daarnaast zal ik de gelegenheid benutten om feedback en reflecties van de aanwezige onderzoekers te verzamelen. \r\n","The number of older migrants in the Netherlands is increasing rapidly, especially among first-generation non-Western migrants. In 1990, there were only 20,000 migrants aged 65 and older, but this number has risen to 180,000 and is expected to reach 550,000 by 2050. Retirement poverty is a significant issue, with around 40% of this group facing financial struggles. A study using 26 qualitative interviews with retirees from Morocco, Suriname, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, and Turkey explored how they manage their economic situation.\r\nThe research revealed four main themes. First, many participants lacked knowledge about their financial situation until they reached retirement. Communication from pension institutions was often seen as late and complicated, although those who worked for larger organizations received more useful and timely information, which helped them adjust their retirement plans. Second, most retirees stopped working before reaching retirement age, usually due to health issues, and working beyond 67 was not considered a viable solution. Their retirement savings were generally low, either due to limited financial knowledge or because saving was not financially feasible. Even those who had some savings didn’t set them aside specifically for retirement. Third, many retirees didn’t use the social security benefits (AIO) available to them. Some refused to apply, seeing the conditions as humiliating, distrusting the authorities, or considering it 'un-Islamic.' Others simply didn’t understand the regulations. Help from children played a role in some cases. Finally, while a few participants remained in contact with their home countries, few sent or received money. Informal support was rare, except from children, though this could be complicated. These findings offer important insights for both policymakers and researchers.","Research on religion's role in immigrant integration in Europe has largely focused on (predominantly Sunni) Muslims, the largest religious minority. This study broadens the scope by comparing Surinamese Muslims not only to Surinamese Christians but also to Hindus—a global religious tradition without historical roots in the destination country. While Islam often faces public suspicion or hostility, Hinduism encounters less controversy and sometimes even Orientalist curiosity. Migration scholars describe Hinduism as an \"ethnic religion\" in the context of twice-migration from the Caribbean to Europe, highlighting its role in community formation and political organization. Given this background, we investigate whether religiosity can be conceptualized similarly across Surinamese Christians, Muslims, and Hindus in the Netherlands. We then analyze how individual religious involvement relates to integration into Dutch society across these traditions. We hypothesize that religiosity is less linked to integration among Surinamese Hindus than among Muslims and that it serves a weaker bridging function than it does for Christians. To test this, we employ multiple-group structural equation modeling. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for research and theory on religion’s role in immigrant integration in an increasingly secular yet historically Christian Europe.","This paper argues that the usual focus on why people migrate is insufficient to fully understand the real-life complexities of migration. Instead, a genuine understanding of migration as a ‘total social fact’ (or a continuous social process) requires the simultaneous examination of why people migrate to particular places but also why they do not migrate elsewhere. Elaborating on Mabogunje’s migration systems theory as well as Bourdieu and Sayad’s conceptualisation of migration as a ‘total social fact’, this paper outlines a conceptual framework for analysing these three foundational questions by situating individuals within the broader social systems that shape and are shaped by migration. Using the case of Algerian migration to France, the paper demonstrates how colonial legacies have not only sustained migration along well-trodden migration corridors, but also impeded the development of alternative migration systems. The paper concludes by arguing how this dynamic has neutralised aspirations and capabilities not only to move but also choose certain destinations over others, revealing the conceptual need to view migration systems as a ‘field of practice’ where knowledge, power, and agency interact.\r\n","This study examines how individual values influence intra-group relationships among highly skilled Chinese migrants in Germany. By integrating Schwartz’s theory of individual and cultural values with Heinich’s pragmatic approach to valuation, it explores how values formed through early socialisation in China—shaped by deeply ingrained cultural frameworks and reinforced by political legacies—continue to structure relational patterns in migration contexts. Based on in-depth interviews with 62 highly skilled Chinese migrants, the findings reveal an atomised community: while cultural familiarity facilitates initial social connections, power and security values undermine trust and collective support. These values, rooted in hierarchical social structures and sustained through governance mechanisms, shape risk-conscious and self-preserving relational strategies, including opportunism, risk-avoidance, and selective trust. Consequently, intra-group cohesion is weakened, limiting the community’s capacity to navigate challenges in German society. By demonstrating how these historically embedded values are reproduced in migration contexts, this study contributes to migration research in three ways. First, it challenges the assumption that co-ethnic, highly skilled migrants naturally form a cohesive and supportive community. Second, it reveals how Legalist governance and pseudo-individualism shape intra-group atomisation beyond national borders. Third, it extends value theory by integrating Heinich’s processual approach to valuation with Schwartz’s structural model of value priorities, offering a context-sensitive analysis of how values are enacted, negotiated, and reproduced in transnational migration settings.","Migrants & the military: more afraid of war, less supportive of strengthening the army\r\nJelle Lössbroek NIDI-KNAW / University of Groningen\r\nGovernments across Europe are planning to expand their armies and increase military spending. Will their populations support this? During the Cold War, European populations supported a larger role for the military, but current populations have a markedly different demography. Specifically, a far larger share of the population consists of migrants. Why would migrants have different attitudes than non-migrants?\r\nMigrants may be more supportive of the military if they experienced armed conflict themselves, or their country did recently, showcasing the importance of defense; many migrants are from countries with more traditional attitudes, which envision a larger role for the military.\r\nAlternatively, migrants may be less supportive, as they may have experienced more abusive behavior by the military, have less patriotic feelings supportive of the military; have the option of ‘returning home’ in case of a crisis.\r\nThe study uses a combination of cross-country surveys conducted between 2015-2024. Preliminary results show that migrants are more afraid than natives that war will come to their new host country. However, they have less confidence in the army, less willing to fight for their new host country should war come, more often feel that defense budgets are too high, less often feel that defense budgets are too low, less likely to want to invest in defense against Russia, and less likely to want to provide military support to Ukraine. Generally, differences are small, however.","The European Social Survey (ESS) is a rich but to many an intimidating source on educational attainment. From its beginning, ESS has collected independent information on qualification and duration as measures of level of education. While the questionnaire format on duration has remained unchanged over all rounds, qualification has been measured in country-specific codes that have changed between rounds and have been post-harmonized in a bewildering number of different ways: EDULVLa, EDULVLb, EISCED. ESS has pioneered the implementation of ISCED-2011 (even before the final introduction of the classification) but has used a survey-specific variety of this standard classification which does not conform to UNESCO standards.\r\nAs a follow-up to earlier analyses of the measurement of education in ESS (Schröder & Ganzeboom, 2014; Ganzeboom & Schröder, 2016), this paper explains the detailed story of education measurement in the ESS in R1-R10 and examines the relative quality of the various measurement, using a latent-variable measurement model with qualification and duration as independent measures of the underlying level of education. We find that duration has surprisingly high measurement quality (only slightly lower that the most detailed version of qualification measurement that takes all country-specific details into account), also in countries with strongly stratified education systems, such as the Netherlands and Germany. Finally, it is shown that that double indicator measurement – by both qualifications and duration – repairs both validity and reliability problems.\r\n","Human values from Schwartz’ seminal theory (Schwartz, 1992, 2012) have been used to describe differences between individuals and provide insight in their relationship with attitudes and behaviors. Values are found to be universal and although value priorities are different across countries (Schwartz & Bardi, 2001), similar value structures have been found across countries. Recent, the availability of panel data encouraged research in value change over time (Leijen et al. 2022). In the current study, using the European Social Survey (ESS), we investigate value change across five generations in 29 countries over 20 years (2002-2020). We expect these changes will not be similar across countries over time as contextual differences may affect individuals’ value development. \r\nIn Schwartz’ values theory, values are located on a theoretical circumplex with opposing and converging values. On a more general level, the values describe the dichotomy of the importance of group/individual, and change/conservation. Although scores on specific values are insightful, when analyzing value change over time it can be more insightful to look at all values simultaneously: As values are related, change in one value change also affects other values.\r\nTo estimate value change over time in the cross-sectional ESS data, following Beugelsdijk et al. (2022), we use archetype analysis (Cutler & Breiman, 1994; Eugster & Leisch, 2009). This approach allows us to describe all individuals in the data using a few distinct observations at the boundary of the datacloud. These few extreme observations are called archetypes and represent a specific combination of value scores. All other observations in the data can be represented as a linear combination of these archetypes. Archetypes are stable, making them suitable for monitoring change across groups and over time.\r\nUsing the human values in the ESS, we find 3 archetypes: Growth-focus, Self-focus, and Social-focus. Each archetype clearly shows the oppositions and compatibilities as in Schwartz’ theory. The Growth archetype considers benevolence and universalism of high importance, and power and achievement of low importance. The Self-focus archetype considers achievement and power as very important and universalism, benevolence, and tradition as unimportant. The Social-focus archetype considers security and tradition very important, and stimulation and hedonism unimportant.\r\nWe focus on value change between generations, across countries. Following Norris and Inglehart (2019), we distinguish 5 generations: Silent-generation, Baby-Boomers, Generation-X, Millennials, and Generation-Z. As expected in adults, changes in values due to time in the 20 years of the ESS are small but present. However, both between generations and between countries substantive changes in value priorities are found. Over generations, from Silent to X there is a strong increase in Self-focus and a decrease in Social-focus in people holding for all countries. Prevalence of Growth-focus is primarily explained by the political and economic situation in the country: The wealthier and more democratic a country in people's youth, the higher the prevalence of growth-focused individuals. Implications of our findings for both academics and practitioners will be discussed.","Against the background of population ageing and policies to stimulate longer working lives, this study examines retirement income in Europe along well-established lines of social stratification: gender and education. Prior studies have shown that generous state pensions are able to alleviate poverty, that is, in countries that provide higher state pension income, poverty is less prevalent among the older population. However, it is unclear to what extent state pension systems are also able to alleviate social inequality in retirement income. Welfare state theories predict that especially social categories that are vulnerable to end up in poverty gain resources from welfare benefits. When thinking of such benefits, people commonly think of unemployment, disability or housing benefits, but old-age benefits in terms of state pension is also considered part of a country’s welfare provisions. Exploiting two decades of ESS data and within- and between-country variation in income as well as state pension generosity, the current study examines this open question by looking at differences in retirement income between men and women, and between the lower and higher educated. It also explores whether social inequality in retirement income has increased over time. What has been the impact of increases in statutory retirement ages? Have welfare austerity measures increased poverty rates? Have certain social categories been hit disproportionately? Answering these questions will identify social groups that face higher risks of poverty in old age and will provide clear policy implications regarding the design of state pension systems.","The Netherlands Institute for Social Research (Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau, in collaboration with Tilburg University) is currently investigating how Dutch citizens’ personal values are changing over time. By analyzing data from ESS rounds 1-11, this study explores whether value priorities are converging or diverging across different social groups. We also study whether we can discern value types and whether value priorities and types coincide with socio-demographic characteristics (‘social sorting’).\r\nPersonal values are also widely considered to shape political beliefs (Rokeach, 1973 in Schwartz, 2014), but how exactly do they influence political opinions in the Netherlands? This research delves into the relationship between personal values and political attitudes on key issues like economic redistribution, climate change, immigration, and cultural liberalism. We explore whether different individuals can hold similar political views for different underlying reasons, driven by distinct value systems.\r\nIn this presentation, we will share our first set of findings, offering new insights into the social sorting of personal values and the connection between these values and political attitudes in the Netherlands.","Who deserves international solidarity and help, and why? The Dutch government has recently decided to provide development aid only to countries and programs that directly serve Dutch interests in trade, security, and migration. But, what does the public think about when and why help should be given? This study examines the extent to which Dutch citizens believe their government should assist countries in Europe and Africa in different crisis situations, such as natural disasters, debt crises, refugee crises, epidemics, and war. We further explore the reasons for providing aid, comparing motivations based on self-interest (trade, safety, and migration) with humanitarian considerations. Using clustering methods, we identify distinct groups based on their response patterns regarding motivations and crisis scenarios. To address these questions, we collected survey data (n=2000) on international solidarity and humanitarian aid in the Netherlands (Global Citizenship in the Netherlands 2025). This study adds to the academic literature by offering new data on Dutch public opinion regarding international solidarity and humanitarian aid in 2025, and contributes to the ongoing debate about the influence of self-interests versus humanitarian values in shaping motivations for helping other countries. By explicitly differentiating between these motivations, and between countries in Europe or in Africa, this research enhances our understanding of public attitudes toward foreign aid. \r\n","Inequality beliefs—beliefs about the causes of success in failure in society—have been identified as a key factor in shaping how people evaluate and respond to inequality. Those who strongly believe in meritocratic principles in particular are less supportive of redistribution, while the opposite has been found for individuals emphasizing the role of structural factors for success. How these beliefs are formed and how individuals come to adopt beliefs either in support of or in contradiction to dominant notions of meritocracy remains a point of contention. Findings vary, especially regarding the relevance of the social positions of individuals—providing diverging and, in some cases, contradictory results. This paper argues for a novel intersectional approach to the study of inequality beliefs to make sense of such scattered findings. People located at different intersections have different experiences, which in turn likely shape their beliefs. As past work has only assessed the influence of these positions as additive variables, the role of intersectionality in belief formation remains unclear. This paper seeks to address this gap by analyzing high-quality survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (N = 17,701) using the MAIHDA approach (Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy) to assess whether and how intersectionality relates to inequality beliefs. Germany provides a particularly interesting case, as beliefs pertaining to work-centered meritocracy are prevalent. Our findings suggest a small but notable effect of intersectional belonging on inequality beliefs, indicating the importance of incorporating an intersectionality perspective into future work within the field.","Local governments increasingly experiment with citizen participation to engage citizens in decision-making, yet these initiatives often fail to attract citizens equally (Elstub & Escobar, 2019; Tonkens & Verhoeven, 2019). In particular, less-educated citizens remain underrepresented, which exacerbates existing social inequalities. While previous research has largely attributed individual constraints and practical considerations to why this group refrains from engaging, less attention has been given to the participatory process itself – especially the role of emotions therein (e.g. Dekker and Uslaner, 2001). This study investigates how stratified emotional repertoires and bureaucratic norms surrounding emotions shape participatory processes. Existing research suggests that, due to shared emotional repertoires, civil servants – primarily higher educated individuals themselves – may favor the communicative styles of more-educated citizens (Young, 2000; Barnes, 2008). This means that participatory settings tend to privilege dispassionate and detached speech over overtly expressing emotions. Such ‘feeling rules’ (Hochschild, 1983) may alienate less-educated citizens, discouraging both their presence and active participation. Simultaneously, civil servants might engage in emotional labor to regulate and shape citizens’ emotions, potentially reinforcing dominant participatory norms (Hochschild, 1983). \r\nUsing a mixed-methods approach, this research first applies qualitative methods – including interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observations – to explore the lived experiences of both citizens and civil servants. In the second phase, surveys and survey-experiments will assess the broader implications of emotional norms for social inequalities in participation. Eventually, this study aims to contribute to the development of more inclusive participatory processes that accommodate diverse emotional repertoires, ultimately fostering more equitable democratic engagement.","In this presentation, I merge insights from the domains of political sociology and critical media studies to explore how the rise of digital information communication technologies (DICTs) has impacted the mobilization of collective sentiments of trust in contemporary social movements. Focusing on the dual dynamics of trust and mistrust, my discussion consider the positive and negative characteristics of digitization for ‘progressive’ justice-oriented social movements as well as reactionary illiberal counter-movements. Through an examination of multiple cases from diverse democratic societies, my discussion follows two pathways. First, I consider how the global rise of DICTs has altered the macro-structural landscape of mobilization for social movements, focusing on enabling dynamics of opportunity and empowerment as well as negative dynamics of repression and control. Second, I focus on questions of agency to consider how DICTs are mobilized as strategic tools by social movement actors, paying special attention to alternative movement-based media. In this context, I discuss how DICTs allow civil society actors to develop innovative tactical repertoires focused on practices of civic vigilance, resistance and democratization. By way of conclusion, some suggestions are given for building an impactful research agenda that explores the grassroots politics of trust in the digital age.","A key goal of groups staging protest is to kickstart political debate. In this paper, we theorize and study how and to what extent protest succeeds in doing so by means of the concept of ‘politicization’. We leverage this concept in two ways. First, we consider politicization as an outcome of protest. Specifically, we map and explain the salience, actor scope and polarization of political elites’ reactions on social media in relation to specific street protest events. Second, we consider politicization as a mechanism. That is, we scrutinize how politicization on social media mediates the impact of protest on the traditional media agenda. We do so by a quantitative analysis of protest (N = 124 events), mass (N = 32.443 news items) and social media data (N = 142.596 tweets) between 2017 and 2019 in Belgium. Our results show that the turnout of a demonstration and the heterogeneity of the mobilized crowd explain variation in politicization on social media, while controlling for particularly potent traditional media and issue controls. Subsequent analyses highlight how social media politicization among politicians mediates the effect of protest on the traditional media agenda. Together, these findings uncover the dynamics of political contestation driven by grassroots mobilization in an era of hybrid media.","Social media platforms like Instagram have become key sources of political news, with influencers, activists, and civil society actors using them to share information. This study examines Instagram as a space for information activism, where citizen-led political mobilization occurs through the aggregation and distribution of political content. While previous research has explored cross-media consumption and the effects of news-sharing, this paper focuses on persuasive strategies employed by two prominent US-based Instagram accounts, one progressive and one conservative. Using a content analysis of 50 posts per account (289 images), we compare the multimodal rhetorical strategies used to engage followers and promote action. Preliminary findings suggest both types of activism rely on argumentation, sourcing, and brandification to establish credibility. Key differences emerge in four areas: (1) Source selection, progressive accounts use legacy media, while conservatives incorporate alternative media and social media posts; (2) Reasoning—progressives use facts and statistics, while conservatives often employ ambiguity and conspiratorial narratives; (3) Core values, progressives highlight inclusivity and social justice, while conservatives appeal to freedom, tradition, and national pride; (4) Mobilization tactics, progressives focus on political participation (e.g., contacting officials, voting), while conservatives promote alarmism. These strategies reflect the broader ways in which Instagram is used to shape political narratives and mobilize audiences.","This study examines the differences in trust in political institutions between migrants and natives in Western Europe, focusing on the roles of religiosity and perceived discrimination. Using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) across 15 Western European countries, the analysis reveals that second-generation migrants exhibit significantly lower political trust than both first-generation migrants and natives. Notably, being of Muslim denomination is linked to reduced political trust, highlighting the varying impact of religious integration on political attitudes within a European context that often marginalizes Muslim communities. Perceived discrimination is another key factor that explains the observed differences in political trust. Second-generation migrants report lower trust due to heightened perceptions of societal discrimination. This suggests that perceived discrimination is crucial in shaping political attitudes, particularly among those who have been born and raised in the host society. Overall, these findings emphasize the complex relationship between religiosity, discrimination, and political trust, offering important implications for understanding the integration and political engagement of migrant populations in Western Europe. This study contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it shifts the focus from explaining patterns of exclusion and discrimination toward immigrants to its effects on their political attitudes. Second, whereas existing literature often relied on single-country designs or pooled survey data, this study provides a cross-national perspective on the relationship between migration background and political trust.","Trust in news media is a critical component of informed citizenship in democratic societies. Individuals have a wide range of options for news consumption, including legacy media, social media, and online news aggregators. However, young adults employ different strategies to evaluate information, and they are also expressing lower trust in the news. Despite some interview studies (e.g. Cotter & Thorson, 2022), more systematic evidence of how people of different ages place trust in various media types and information sources is so far lacking. \r\nThis paper examines to what extent we can find more systematic evidence for the emergence of new media trust repertoires from a cross-national perspective. We use the Media & News Eurobarometer Survey 2023 and employ multilevel Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to inductively find which media trust repertoires can currently be observed in the European Union (N=25,938). The results show four different latent clusters that characterize media trust repertoires in the EU: (a) TV/radio-oriented, (b) public broadcasters + press, (c) online/peer-oriented, (d) non-digitals. Countries cluster in three different latent classes. \r\nIn none of the four trust clusters digital media have fully replaced more traditional media, but for more than 90% of the individuals online media are important in the news consumption. While age is a strong predictor of repertoire membership (as expected), also educational level and type of news consumption have additional predictive value. In countries with higher GDP and more press freedom relatively more people belong to the public broadcaster and press cluster.\r\n\r\n","High support for freedom of speech is crucial for a democratic society. Most research suggests that the principle of freedom of speech is widely endorsed. However, freedom of speech is neither absolute nor unlimited and may conflict with other democratic rights and values. This raises the question of to what extent and how people learn to navigate and balance the dilemmas around free speech.\r\nThis study focuses on the ‘formative years’ that arguably shape democratic citizenship, employing Dutch panel data among adolescents aged 12 to 16. We analyze four aspects in forming (conditional) support for free speech. First, we study the structure of these attitudes to assess to what extent they become more structured as adolescents age. Second, we study the levels of support to assess how adolescents position themselves. Third, we test the dynamics of social identity theory, which implies that support for free speech wavers if it conflicts with one’s in-group. Fourth, we test to what extent socialization agencies (parents, peers, and teachers) contribute to the formation of attitudes toward freedom of speech. \r\nOur results show high and growing support for freedom of speech. We find that attitudes are structured by support for vertical free speech (related to state-citizen relationships) and horizontal free speech (related to citizen-citizen interactions). Unlike the former, the latter shows variation across time and social groups. Some identities lose influence on support for horizontal free speech, whereas others become more important. Moreover, we find evidence that teacher interactions affect support for free speech.","Around the world, many people express strong support for democracy and consider it the most desirable form of government. However, research suggests that people think differently about what democracy actually entails. For instance, people in Vietnam, a country rated as non-democracy by the Freedom House Index, consider their country democratic. This raises the question of what people mean when they think of democracy. What are they actually supporting and is there a difference in their understanding of what democracy entails? Previous research show that notions of democracy is a multi-dimensional concept. Given this, most studies have used an item-base approach. However, this approach assumes observed variables are continuous, and overlooks the existence of distinct subgroups with diverse perceptions. There is an alternative person-based approach, which groups individuals based on similar perceptions. Some studies provide an insight regarding notions of democracy by grouping individuals with similar perceptions. However, these studies predominantly focus on democratic countries. As a result, little is known about how individuals in non-democratic countries combine different dimension into one encompassing notion of democracy. Secondly, previous studies did not systematically investigate determinants of notions of democracy, it is largely unknown which macro- and micro-level factors influence conceptions of democracy. Analyzing a data from World Value Surveys Wave 7, we use Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to study notions of democracy in democratic and non-democratic countries. Additionally, we conduct a theory-driven study based on political learning theory, modernization theory, and redistributive theories to examine how individuals' notions of democracy are shaped.","Although the literature is mixed on the question to what extent attitudinal polarization is increasing in Western societies, scholars agree that polarization is very prevalent in people’s minds. However, systematic explorations of why some individuals perceive more polarization than others remain relatively scarce, with limited focus on the role of the media and the generalization of people’s own attitudes only.\r\nWe propose that people base their perceptions of political polarization, in part, on the perceived attitudinal extremity within their social network, as they may project the extremity of attitudes of their social network onto the extremity of attitudes in society at large. Although extensive research has established the critical role of social networks in shaping attitudes and perceptions, this study is the first to consider the role of social networks to explain perceptions of polarization.\r\nIn a pre-registered study among 879 Dutch participants, we found that having at least one strong tie (i.e., a close contact) with extremely conservative immigration attitudes was strongly associated with perceiving more political polarization while having at least one extremely progressive strong tie was not. Similarly, the number of weak ties (e.g., acquaintances, neighbours) with extremely conservative attitudes also related to perceiving more polarization. Strong anti-immigration attitudes might be readily available when individuals construct perceptions of polarization, as they might be voiced more assertively or provocatively. Our results imply that perceptions of strong polarization might be reduced by having more dialogue, both with moderate and extreme social ties.","Following the media, a variety of groups feel unheard in current society. The feeling is associated with larger societal issues such as polarisation, declining institutional trust, and populism. Simultaneously, media structures and conventions may limit who or what is heard. What it means to feel unheard collectively, however, remains unclear. To better understand how feeling (un)heard is given meaning in society, this study explores how the concept is socially constructed within Dutch news articles and its development between 1990 and 2023.\r\nWe conducted a quantitative, longitudinal content analysis of five of the largest Dutch newspapers. We explored which groups feel (un)heard, by whom, regarding which topics, what it means, whose voice states they are (un)heard, and whether feeling (un)heard is framed as an explanation or solution to societal issues. Relevant articles were selected from Nexis Uni, resulting in a corpus of 17,248 articles. A codebook was inductively developed to code a random stratified sample of 395 articles manually.\r\nThe analysis provided preliminary insights into different elements of feeling heard, ranging from having a voice, to equal treatment, to the implementation of policies. The findings also show that unheard groups are in a dependent relationship with whom they want to be heard by. Whereas this apparent dependency might suggest otherwise, the reported unheard groups are not solely traditionally disadvantaged but often include middle-class or elite groups. This suggests that feeling unheard is a broader societal experience. Although, privileged groups may be more visible to journalists, leaving other unheard groups, unheard in news media. \r\n","Steden omarmen in toenemende mate digitale technologieën om als \"slimme\" en datagestuurde organisaties stedelijk bestuur en dienstverlening efficiënter en effectiever te organiseren. De inzet van instrumenten zoals slimme camera’s, geluidssensoren, openbare wifi, deelmobiliteit en digital twins belooft bij te dragen aan een hogere levenskwaliteit door verbeterde veiligheid, efficiëntie en leefbaarheid. Tegelijkertijd hebben deze technologieën een aanzienlijke maatschappelijke impact, omdat ze fundamentele waarden raken, zoals autonomie, privacy, transparantie, inclusiviteit en empowerment. Bovendien wordt hun effectiviteit regelmatig ter discussie gesteld. Ondanks de dominantie van het smart city-discours binnen diverse disciplines, bestuursmodellen en beleidsorganen, zijn de conceptuele fundamenten ervan zelden gebaseerd op democratische politieke constellaties of worden ze als apolitiek beschouwd. Dit discours wordt versterkt door de technocratische en solutionistische benadering die veel steden hanteren, wat het debat dreigt te depolitiseren. Dit onderzoek richt zich op de manier waarop klassieke vormen van lokale representatie zich positioneren binnen technologiegedreven beleidsvorming en -uitvoering en in hoeverre zij een tegenwicht kunnen bieden. Op basis van documentanalyse, observaties en interviews wordt de politieke dynamiek van smart city-beleid in Rotterdam onderzocht, met een focus op hoe gemeenteraadsleden hun kaderstellende, controlerende en vertegenwoordigende rol invullen binnen smart city-dossiers en welke impact zij daarmee hebben op het lokale beleid. De bevindingen dragen bij aan een beter begrip van de democratische verankering van digitalisering in lokale politiek en beogen een toolkit te ontwikkelen met concrete handvatten voor het versterken van politieke zeggenschap in de 'smart city'.","This article delves into the power dynamics of truth claim legitimation and contestation amid the Covid-19 pandemic, focusing on debates surrounding anti-Covid-19 measures in the digital public sphere. The surge in alternative knowledge challenging mainstream science's authority is a key aspect of post-truth discussions. Official knowledge, encompassing science, politics, and mass media, faces skepticism as people turn to alternative forms of information. In turn, mainstream post truth scholars tend to defend the boundaries of science by debunking alternative knowledge claims. Rather than aligning with mainstream post truth perspectives, this study adopts a symmetrical stance, exploring how truth claims are legitimized and contested in the digital public sphere. Utilizing Steve Fuller's knowledge power games model, we examine truth wars between established experts and adversarial actors. Through thematic content analysis of the Dutch Corona “Truth Wars”, we identify three truth-claimer types, each employing overlapping and distinct truth claim legitimation strategies. This nuanced approach challenges the dichotomy between rational thinkers and affect-based populists, offering a more diverse and complex view of the discursive landscape. The findings contribute to fostering inclusive and informed public discourse amid heightened social polarization and political instability in many countries.","Parlementair vertoog over immigratie weerspiegelt niet simpelweg hoe volksvertegenwoordigers de statistische realiteiten van migranteninstroom en vreemdelingenpopulatie waarnemen. Elke taaluiting van parlementariërs is een berekende tussenkomst in een politiek landschap, gestuurd door geanticipeerde reacties van tegenspelers en medestanders in de discussie. Met andere woorden, ook veranderingen in dat politieke landschap hebben mogelijk een invloed op hoe over immigratie gesproken wordt. In het veldvocabularium van Bourdieu en Snow: positie-innames in het discursieve veld rond immigratie worden mogelijks gebroken door de logica van het politieke veld.\r\nDe opkomst en toetreding tot de Belgische Kamer van anti-immigratiepartij Vlaams Blok biedt een bijzondere opportuniteit om zo’n breuk te onderzoeken in het Belgisch parlementair vertoog over immigratie. Om dat te onderzoeken, wordt 80 jaar aan parlementaire handelingen geanalyseerd. Met een thesaurus die de dimensies migranteninstroom en vreemdelingenpopulatie dekt, worden fragmenten over immigratie geïsoleerd uit de parlementaire discussies. Een tekstnetwerkanalyse van de geïsoleerde fragmenten toont verschillen in het woordgebruik van parlementariërs in hun tussenkomsten over immigratie. Aan de hand van deze techniek brengen we per legislatuur in kaart hoe het immigratievertoog van verschillende partijen zich tot elkaar verhoudt.\r\nWe verwachten dat het aantal tussenkomsten over immigratie in recente jaren hoger ligt dan aan het begin van de analyseperiode. Meer bepaald vanaf de jaren ‘90 verwachten we een plotse toename, corresponderend met de opkomst van het Vlaams Blok. Daarnaast onderzoeken we hoe andere politieke partijen reageren op het discours van het Vlaams Blok (later Vlaams Belang) door de tekstnetwerken van verschillende legislaturen met elkaar te vergelijken.","Over het algemeen leidt werkloosheid of baanverlies tot afnemend welzijn, maar de roltheorie en latente deprivatietheorie voorspellen dat andere productieve activiteiten de verloren latente voordelen van betaald werk kunnen compenseren. In een ‘mega-analyse’ van zes longitudinale studies met 500.000+ observaties van meer dan 100.000 respondenten in 20 Europese landen onderzoeken we hoe werkloosheid samenhangt met levenstevredenheid in verschillende leeftijdsgroepen, en of deze relaties anders zijn voor vrijwilligers dan voor niet-vrijwilligers. Resultaten van first-difference modellen laten zien dat werkloosheid negatief samenhangt met levenstevredenheid, en dat mensen van 35-55 jaar het meest te lijden hebben onder gedwongen werkloosheid. De effecten van werkeloosheid zijn niet verschillend voor vrijwilligers en niet-vrijwilligers, wat suggereert dat vrijwilligerswerk geen buffer vormt tegen de stress van werkloosheid. In de gangbare sociologische theorie lijkt de overtuiging te bestaan dat betaald werk en vrijwilligerswerk tot op zekere hoogte uitwisselbare latente sociale functies hebben, maar onze robuuste resultaten leveren geen bewijs voor dit idee. De resultaten wijzen op een sterke sociale norm in Westerse samenlevingen rond betaald werk als de productieve activiteit die iemands identiteit vormt.","Professional identity (PI) is important in relation to work. Yet, increasing complexity of careers challenge the development of PI. This is even more the case for disciplines such as sociology, where there is a diffuse connection between discipline and professional field. In this study we analyze how this is experienced by sociology graduates working outside academia, using qualitative interviews. Since the programs did not prepare for a specific occupation, the focus in education was mostly on academic formation, while the PI formation only really started after graduation. Many of the interviewees used their job search to find out how to best align their personal motivations, which typically involved a commitment to solving societal issues, with professional work. Often their exploration involved a first ‘in-between job’. Next to these values, interviewees also indicated that they distinguished themselves from colleagues in a critical and practical-analytical ‘way of thinking’ regarding problems and interventions. Hence, while interviewees rarely called themselves sociologist, there appeared to be a latent sociological dimension to their PI. An additional finding was the fact that the interviewees showed a shifting appreciation of the diffuseness: often this was exactly what attracted them to sociology in the first place, yet when entering the labor market many were uncertain about possible occupations. After some years though, they again valued the fact that they could easily shift between occupations. The insights provided by this study help sociology programs to better facilitate the process of PI formation of their students, while these also hold relevance for the broader literature on PI.","The formal childcare sector is experiencing major staff shortages, putting pressure on the quality provided within the childcare centre and consequently on the children. One cause of the staff shortage is the insufficient supply of new childcare professionals. This study examines pre-service childcare professionals’ intentions to enter the field in relation to the following three aspects: study choice motivation, practicum-based experiences and perceptions regarding the working conditions. Data were collected from students (n=177) enrolled in a 7th-year secondary vocational education program in Flanders (Belgium). Results indicate that only a minority of pre-service childcare professionals intend to enter the profession. Logistic regression analyses reveal that those who perceive that they have good career opportunities (i.e. advancement to staff leadership) are more likely to enter the profession, as do those who showed a high degree of appreciation for the work during their practicum. However, study choice motivation did not affect their intentions to enter the profession, as motivation was uniformly high across all pre-service childcare professionals. These results suggest that only a minority of the pre-service childcare professionals are likely to enter the profession. Those who do may advance to staff leaders within the childcare centre and subsequently leave the profession, exacerbating workforce shortages.","In alle sociale verbanden praten mensen met elkaar over elkaar, juist ook professionals, collega’s en leidinggevenden. Dit onder elkaar praten over iemand die er niet bij is, wordt soms roddelen genoemd. In deze bijdrage wordt roddelen gezien als  een specifieke vorm van communiceren/interacteren waar minimaal drie personen een sociaal verband met elkaar vormen: een roddeltriade. Deze roddeltriade bestaat uit verteller, luisteraar en de beroddelde persoon; met daarnaast nog vaak omstanders, al dan niet aanwezig. \r\nBij roddelen is sprake van in- en buitensluiten van anderen, en van een verhaal met een zekere nieuwswaarde voor de betrokkenen. Deze nieuwswaarde geldt voor minimaal één betrokkene in de triade en wordt besproken in vertrouwen. Het besprokene omvat  een (morele of ethische) evaluatie van bepaald gedrag of interactie, als kwestie die in die relatie of situatie meer of minder taboe is.\r\nHet aangeraakte taboe in deze relatie of dit sociaal verband kan of mag niet besproken worden, waarmee het vertrouwelijke karakter en de afwezigheid van de beroddelde essentieel lijkt. In de paper wordt gezocht naar een methode om de verschillende vormen van roddelen te exploreren en interventies mogelijk te maken; met als doel mogelijk destructieve gevolgen van roddelen in kleine sociale verbanden te beperken. Het streven is het ontwikkelen van een interventiemethodiek voor leidinggevenden, en professionals die inzetbaar is in de sociale sector, onderwijs en gezondheidszorg.\r\n","This paper aims to examine how the South Korean labour market is segmented based on workers’ employment trajectory patterns. Over the decades, labour market segmentation literature has shed light on explaining labour market inequality through non-competing segments that advantages certain workers over the others, namely, insiders over outsiders. Nevertheless, despite post-industrialised societies demonstrating increasingly diversifying employment trajectories, little is known as to how the labour market is segmented when taking into account the potential job mobility over time. Against this background, this paper investigates the labour market segmentation patterns taking into account employment trajectories using group-based multi-trajectory modelling on Korean Labor & Income Panel Study data. We find a clear evidence of a segmented labour market, where outsiders have distinct employment trajectories from insiders, and women’s overrepresentation in outsiders. Furthermore, outsiders are trapped in ‘outsider orbit’, indicating a structural barrier that limits women to outsider jobs in Korea.","Firms’ human resource (HR) policies are key determinants of employment quality. A shift from organizational-oriented (OO) to market-oriented (MO) policies has been observed, with OO firms emphasizing long-term stability through standardized wages and permanent contracts, while MO firms focus on flexibility with performance-based pay and non-standard employment (NSE) contracts. While this flexibility benefits employers, it often results in greater job and income instability for employees, particularly in firms with a high share of low-paid or temporary workers.\r\nDespite prior research highlighting variations in firms’ remuneration and contract policies, their impact on employees' experienced job quality remains unclear. To address this gap, we cluster 1,325 large Dutch firms (500+ employees) based on their contract and remuneration policies, using data from the 2018 Dutch Structure of Earnings Survey (SES) and the Social Statistical Database (SSB). We identify seven distinct clusters: some with OO characteristics, others with MO traits, and some combining elements of both. We then link these clusters to the 2018 National Working Conditions Survey (NEA), analysing the job satisfaction and perceived working conditions of 23,513 employees. This allows us to examine how these employer clusters influence employees' experienced job quality.\r\n","The Netherlands is known for its high share of employees in fixed-term contracts (FTCs), partly because employers face few restrictions when using FTCs. However, trade unions and employers are allowed to deviate from national legislation in collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) regarding the use of these contracts. The aim of this study is to explore how such agreements in CBAs affect careers of employees with an FTC. \r\nWe use a unique dataset on Dutch CBAs which was linked to Dutch register data. This allowed us to (1) identify employees that were covered by a CBA and which ones were not; and (2) which agreements were made in these CBAs about the use of FTCs. We used hidden Markov models to (1) identify different states of employment quality based on individuals contract type and income; (2) analyze how individuals move between these states; and (3) study how CBAs affect these movements. \r\nWe identified eight states of employment quality, three of which were characterized by having an FTC (differentiated by wage level), and two of which were characterized by having a permanent contract (one with low wages and one with high wages). Being covered by a CBA increased the likelihood of transitioning to a permanent contract for those in the low and middle income groups. In addition, individuals covered by a CBA that deviated from national legislation on the use of FTCs were much less likely to transition to a permanent contract than individuals covered by a CBA that followed national legislation.","In OECD countries, there has been an increasing interest in self-employment in later life, with policy makers particularly interested in those moving into solo self-employment. This is because this form of work is seen as offering flexibility and autonomy to older workers as they extend their working lives. The UK Department for Work and Pensions (2024), for example, stated that “Self-employment is a popular option for many older workers who want to build on past experience, develop specialist knowledge and increase control over their working lives.” This paper makes a contribution to the literature by developing a model for understanding how, and why, people end up moving into solo self-employment after age 50. This is based on 20 in-depth UK life course interviews lasting around 90 minutes each, from a sample that has been carefully constructed to capture the diversity of solo self-employment. Using a life-course approach (Elder 2004), we find that for most individuals ‘turning points’ related to work, household or health circumstances were important in terms of generating a need, or desire, for work with greater autonomy. At the same time, the principles of ‘linked lives’ and ‘life stage’ generated the opportunity structure that allow individuals to become self-employed. This implies that government attempts to promote self-employment as a means of extending working lives are not likely to succeed unless individuals have such opportunity structures, and much greater focus is therefore needed on making work as an employee more hospitable to older workers.","Dominant narratives often describe solo self-employment as either a voluntary embrace of entrepreneurialism, or a labour market necessity. This article moves beyond this dichotomy by situating solo self-employment within key contradictions marking contemporary work: the tension between rising expectations for self-expression and autonomy in work, and the increasing precarization that makes these aspirations harder to achieve.\r\nFocusing on architecture and design in the creative industries in the Netherlands and the UK — sectors marked by high expectations for meaningful work alongside precarious conditions — the research employs a mixed-methods design, combining a vignette survey (n=180, vignette N=1080) with in-depth interviews. It explores workers' preferences for solo self-employment and how these are shaped by their working context.\r\nThe vignette survey results show that creative autonomy and self-expression, alongside pay and benefits, are highly valued, while employment type (self-employment or wage employment) by itself is not significant. Interviews offer potential explanations for these findings, revealing that many creative workers pursue self-employment to \"take back control\" — seeking better income, work-life balance, and creative freedom. In other cases, however, self-employment introduces new barriers, with financial risks forcing compromises between material security and self-expression.\r\nThis article argues that self-employment functions less as an ideological embrace of entrepreneurship and more as a strategy for balancing the oft-contradictory expectations from work. Yet, the success of this strategy remains shaped by workers’ starting resources. Ultimately, while self-employment emerges as a response to contradictions in creative work, it risks reproducing the very inequalities that it seeks to overcome.","As retirement ages increase, reducing working hours before retirement is seen as a way to facilitate longer working lives of those workers struggling with work demands. The current study analyzes individual, household, job, and organizational factors that shape the decision to reduce work hours before retirement. Three key questions are examined: Who plans to reduce working hours before retirement, who is actually reducing working hours, and what explains the discrepancy between the two? Using two waves of the NIDI pension panel survey, we examine the plans to reduce work hours of 2,227 full-time employees aged 60-63 nested in 799  organizations, and track their actual behavior after retirement. Results suggest that 23% of the sample plans to reduce working hours in the years before retirement age. Older workers with poor health and high job pressure were more likely to plan to reduce working hours. In the follow-up years 30% of the older workers actually reduced working hours. Plans proved to be strong predictors of actual behavior. Within those who plan to reduce working hours before retirement, around half actually reduces them; around 30% of those who were uncertain ends up reducing work hours; and a fifth of those who planned to work full-time until retirement eventually reduces work hours. Findings from this study contribute to scientific debates about agency during later working lives and to policy debates about gradual retirement pathways.","Collective bargaining is often considered a wage-regulating institution, yet empirical evidence on the relation between collectively bargained pay rates and earned wages is scarce. Traditional theorizing in industrial relations suggests that the determination of wages is a core motivation for both employers and trade unions to engage in bargaining. The decentralization thesis argues that employers, seeking to maximize discretion over pay, may be loath to negotiate binding provisions on wages. In this study, we introduce the concept of the earned-bargained wage gap to explore the relation between bargained pay rates and earned wages across seven European countries. We ask to what extent the earned-bargained wage gap differs between sectors and countries, and whether it is moderated by gender and occupational class. Matching pay rates from 83 collective agreements from 7 countries to a sample of 838.609 matched observations in the European Structure of earnings survey, we pilot three strategies for estimating the earned-bargained wage gap. We find substantial differences between countries in the extent to which bargained pay rates exceeded or fell short of median earned wages, as well as in the extent to which collectively bargained pay scales covered the full distribution of earned wages, or only the top or bottom deciles. Furthermore, matching occupation-coded bargained pay rates in Dutch collective agreements to individual respondents’ earned wages, our study showed that groups of workers known to earn relatively higher wages in the labor market also earned larger ‘wage cushions’, i.e. wages in excess of bargained pay rates.","Precarious jobs – characterized by insecurity or unsafe conditions, are precarious in terms of the continuity and quantity of work, limited opportunities for advancement, and pose significant challenges to workers’ well-being. Precarity can manifest in work (i.e., related to the continuity and stability of work), at work (i.e., unsafe or exploitative conditions), or from work (i.e., jobs failing to meet basic financial or personal needs). While the impact of precarious work is often examined at the workplace, its effects extend beyond, influencing individuals as they move across multiple aspects of daily life. \r\nTo explore these dynamics, we conducted a working-along study with individuals in Rotterdam holding precarious jobs (n=12). We recorded all interactions, focusing on the origins and nature of their work, job content, decision-making processes, job continuity, and perceived support. We thematically coded all references of precarity in, at, and from work, analyzed participants’ considerations regarding (future) trade-offs and job sustainability, and synthesized our findings to conceptualize precarity as a social phenomenon. \r\n\tOur preliminary findings suggest that precarity on the job not always translates into broader life, especially for older workers. However, when individuals experience precarity from work (i.e., financial strain, (unpaid) overtime, or irregular hours) social support from colleagues and friends becomes crucial. These networks were often essential for survival rather than for fostering personal growth and well-being. This underscores the dual role of social connections in precarious work: they serve as a safety net but may also limit opportunities for long-term stability and advancement.\r\n","Despite policy advancements aimed at promoting gender equality in caregiving responsibilities, paternity leave uptake and the reduction of work hours among male employees remains limited. Drawing on Dutch administrative register data encompassing all male employees in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from 2010 onward, this study examines the influence of male managerial role modeling on male employees' parental leave and work hours reduction decisions. While previous research has qualitatively explored workplace cultures and peer effects as critical determinants of leave-taking behavior, empirical evidence from large-scale, generalizable samples remains scarce. Using multilevel probit models, this study investigates whether male managers who actively take paternity leave or reduce working hours after childbirth serve as influential role models, thereby increasing the likelihood of their male subordinates to do the same. Preliminary analyses reveal considerable variation in parental leave uptake. By leveraging high-quality administrative data, this research circumvents common methodological limitations such as social desirability and selectivity biases associated with surveys. The findings hold substantial implications for organizational practices, suggesting that male leaders actively demonstrating caregiving responsibilities can effectively foster supportive environments and normalize paternity leave uptake among men.","Building on a large body of studies that use correspondence experiments to show discrimination in hiring on a diverse range of grounds such as ethnicity, race or gender this paper aims to provide analytical clarity on the different micro-level mechanisms that drive discriminatory hiring outcomes. Moving beyond the distinction between taste-based and statistical discrimination, I propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes five micro-level mechanisms: taste-based, variance-based individual-level, mean-based statistical, mean-variance statistical and prototype-based discrimination. I describe and formalise each mechanism, summarize what we already know about their presence and dominance from existing studies, offer a comparison between them, and identify new avenues for research.  In doing so, the paper serves two key objectives. First, I provide analytical detail on the mechanisms that the current literature generally relies on when theoretically describing discriminatory hiring outcomes. Second, I generate a set of testable hypotheses which can be used in future studies. The results of this theoretical exercise show that the mechanisms of taste-based, variance-based individual-level, mean-based statistical, mean-variance statistical and prototype-based discrimination provide distinct explanations. Yet, while some evidence supports taste-based discrimination, empirical support for other mechanisms remains limited. I identify the need to systematically study the proposed mechanisms in comparison to taste-based discrimination using laboratory experiments, factorial survey experiments, and observational designs. This will help assess their relative explanatory power across different hiring contexts and clarify their role in driving discriminatory hiring outcomes.","Research on labor market inequalities frequently identifies discrimination as a contributing factor affecting minority groups such as migrants, women, and sexual minorities, who face significant disadvantages in employment and wages. Although these groups are often studied separately, individuals are characterized by the intersection of their migration background, gender, and sexuality. Currently, there is limited consensus on how the combination of two minority statuses leads to labor market disadvantages, and few studies have examined the simultaneous effects of all three. This study contributes to the literature by analyzing the role of the intersection of migration background, gender, and sexual minority status on the likelihood of employment and wages in the Netherlands. The study uses administrative population data from the Netherlands which include sufficient observations across all groups. Information on gender, country of origin and committed relationships, are used to construct the intersecting minority groups. We expect that migrant women face the greater disadvantages compared to migrant men. However, we also expect that sexual minority status may mitigate the disadvantages associated with gender and migration background. Although sexual minorities challenge traditional gender norms, sexual minorities signal liberal values that contrast and mitigate the more conservative values often associated with migrant women. By examining employment and wages, this research offers a comprehensive understanding of the role the intersection for disadvantages when securing employment and when translating labor into earnings. We expect that the role of intersecting minority statuses may be larger for employment compared to wages.","The #MeToo movement has heightened media awareness of sexual harassment and, more broadly, social unsafety in the workplace. However, scientific understanding of social unsafety lags behind. While scholars recognize that different dimensions of social unsafety are interrelated, research provides a rather fragmented view because social unsafety behaviors are predominantly examined in isolation. Furthermore, intersectionality is rarely considered, although people likely experience social unsafety differently based on the intersection of their various socio-demographic characteristics. To address these gaps, this study uses large-scale, representative survey data on Dutch employees (NEA, 2022), taking a holistic and intersectional approach to understand patterns in experiences with various dimensions of social unsafety in the workplace and its differences across intersectional groups. Preliminary descriptive findings show that incidences of social unsafety among Dutch employees are remarkably low, especially for transgressive behaviors like bullying, intimidation, unwanted sexual attention, and physical violence. Latent class analyses identified an eight-class solution, for which we now focus on the four classes (altogether, 5.64 percent) showing a relatively high probability of experiencing mentioned transgressive behaviors. All four classes were likely to experience conflicts at work. In contrast, they varied greatly in their experiences with incivility and psychological unsafety. The four classes further diverged in terms of perpetrator power: two classes experienced social unsafety from supervisors, one class from coworkers, and one from both supervisors and coworkers. Next steps are testing how (intersections of) gender, migration background, educational level, and age influence the probability of Dutch employees belonging to the identified social unsafety classes.","The expansion of higher education has intensified competition among graduates, leading employers to consider additional signals of productivity, such as work experience. While many students enter the labor market with significant work experience, research on its long-term labour market returns remains limited. This study examines how different types of student employment—field-related and non-field-related—affect early career outcomes in the Netherlands, where student employment is widespread. Additionally, we explore whether these effects vary by socio-economic status (SES). Theoretically, we draw on human capital and signalling theories to explain the labour market implications of student employment. Human capital theory suggests that work experience enhances skills and long-term career prospects, whereas signalling theory posits that its effects may be strongest at labour market entry. Using register data from Statistics Netherlands (2011–2020), we analyse a cohort of 86,565 graduates, tracking their student employment history (2011–2013) and post-graduation labour market outcomes (2014–2020). We apply a Hidden Markov Model to construct a latent employment quality variable based on employment status, income, and contract type. This allows us to estimate the probability of entering different employment quality states at labour market entry and the transitions to higher-quality employment over time, comparing outcomes across work experience types and socio-economic groups. By distinguishing between types of student employment and their interaction with SES, this study provides new insights into how work experience shapes early career outcomes and its implications for social inequality.","Previous research examined gender representations in neofolk content using only qualitative methods focused on women. No quantitative analysis of sexualized objectification for both genders had been attempted. This study employs a mixed-methodology explanatory sequential approach for investigating the sexualized objectification of (wo)men in neofolk lyrics. Firstly, following the methodology of traditional quantitative content analysis, three coders coded lyrics of 296 neofolk songs. Findings revealed a substantial disparity, with women being the primary targets across all initial instances exhibiting elements of sexualized objectification compared to men. Particularly notable are elements of Sexualized movements and Provocative clothing whose targets were solely women. Additionally, results indicated a slight increase in overall sexualized objectification over time. Secondly, responsive semi-structured interviews with two participants were conducted to explore how Croatian young adults experience and integrate neofolk lyrics into their everyday lives and gender performativities. Both participants were in their twenties and self-identified as women. Qualitative data disclosed themes around the usage of neofolk lyrics as a means of fulfilling the neoliberal demand for emotional productivity, as well as duality and selectivity in feminine readings and the integration of neofolk lyrics. Practical implications of media literacy education, limitations, and future inquiry paths are discussed and suggested.  ","Questions of resistance and activism, and social and political consciousness in Hip Hop culture have been studied within the multidisciplinary Hip Hop scholarship, shaped by the Hip Hop Studies Reader That’s the Joint! published in 2003 by Routledge. Even before this publication, in the 1990s, seminal work of Tricia Rose, Black Noise, called for academia to give its overdue attention to Hip Hop as culture and music genre and industry. The Journal of Hip Hop studies has been published since 2010, and since 2020 the Global Hip Hop Studies Journal. Across these, and many other relevant contributions, the debates about politically conscious, resistant and authentic Hip Hop and implications of such discourses have become a commonplace.  To add to a more nuanced and less romanticized idea of resistance and politically conscious Hip Hop and building on recent scholarship of Justin A. Williams and Griffith J. Rollefson on Hip Hop as postcolonial (counter) narrativity and activism, I have become concerned with exploring the multitude of resistance avenues in European postcolonial context. The significant lack of focus on emotions and emotional discourses in Hip Hop culture stood out. This paper will elaborate the emotions framework and approach to the study of Hip Hop culture and music, and discuss the benefits, challenges and limitations of applying sentiment analysis (with R) to the rap and Hip Hop songs of Dutch rappers. The discussion will also include some preliminary findings based on a limited data sample. ","Many Dutch youngsters are dissatisfied with their own financial situation. They feel limited to do things that they consider important in life and experience stress because they feel ‘stuck’ in their current situation. Almost half of the youngsters mention ‘getting rich’ as a life goal. From rags to riches narratives, grinding, and stacking are not uncommon themes in (Dutch) rap music. The lyrics of artists are often about earning money fast and spending it on luxury goods. Rappers are also very keen to radiate success on social media. Youngsters use rap music to reflect on themselves and the world around them, even though the scripts provided in rap music are not always as reliable or authentic as they seem. Therefore, this study focuses on the following research question: how do listeners of Dutch rap view messages about money, status and luxury goods? By means of music and photo elicitation in a focus group setting we investigated how participants respond to these kinds of messages, how they negotiate this meaning together, and which contextual factors influence this process. ","Generative artificial intelligence (AI) in music creation and production may significantly disrupt human creativity within the music industry. While existing research has mainly concentrated on AI’s impact on copyright issues or recommendation algorithms, the perspectives and strategies of musicians themselves in relation to this development have largely been overlooked. These perspectives are crucial because they can shape the trajectory of technological disruptions; determining which tools gain adoption and how they are integrated into creative processes of musicians. Furthermore, this research gap is also of academic importance as if forces us to rethink the meaning and definition of both creativity and labour in music creation and production.  \r\nThis qualitative study seeks to bridge this research gap by exploring the relationship between musicians and generative AI. It focuses on musicians' attitudes towards AI and the ways they engage with these technologies in their professional practices. Special attention is given to how AI influences labor dynamics within the music industry, from production to distribution, and how musicians perceive their role in the creative process in light of these tools. The research is based on 15 semi-structured interviews with musicians (based in Europe) at various career stages. Through this inductive, exploratory approach, the study aims to offer a nuanced understanding of the intersection between music, creativity, technology, and labour.","This article proposes a theoretical framework for understanding how musicians justify their use of digital platforms, despite expressing criticisms. It draws upon Boltanski and Thévenot's sociology of justification, arguing that musicians navigate multiple, often conflicting, \"orders of worth\" when making decisions about platform engagement. Social media is used as a case study to illustrate how musicians negotiate \"tests,\" \"critiques,\" and \"compromises\" between these competing values. The framework aims to move beyond standard critiques of platformization by foregrounding musicians' own critical engagement with platforms. This is done by highlighting the ways they justify their uses of specific platforms as well as the ways they support their criticisms on platformization’s implications for their work. Ultimately, it advocates for more nuanced empirical research informed by this theoretical lens.","Music festival scholars note how these events have increasingly become a part of urban regeneration projects and placemaking in a process referred to as “festivalisation” (Hitters & Mulder, 2020). Recent research has found that over the past 20 years, music festivals have shifted from using large outdoor spaces, to smaller, more intimate indoor spaces (Calkins and Swartjes, forthcoming). While urban spatial inequality is well-researched (Sampson 2012; Wilson 2011) including work on the role of redlining in shaping the retail landscape (Kwate and Loh, 2016), there is very little engagement with spatial inequality in festival research.  In this paper, we therefore explore the extent to which festivalisation happens more in certain urban areas over others. In other words, we question which neighborhoods tend to reap the supposed benefits of festivalisation and which neighborhoods do not. More specifically, we propose a framework to understand how festivalisation is shaped by socio-spatial inequality through the use of Exploratory Spatial Analysis and statistical modelling. Taking a comparative spatio-temporal approach, we study 2.456 festival locations in 389 neighborhoods throughout Rotterdam (NL) and Milwaukee (US) over a nearly half century span of time (1970 – 2018). Statistical modelling results show that the concentration of festival locations is shaped by the interaction of race/ethnicity and income levels, controlling for other neighborhood factors (density, income, % children). We argue that acknowledging the city is a site of difference and contestation will set more realistic expectations about how festivals play a role in the city and for whom.","Nightclubs are facing increasing pressure due to a variety of economic and urban developments such as gentrification, densification, post-pandemic recovery and inflation. At the same time, as nightclubs weather these challenges and threats, there is a parallel trend of increasing governmental recognition and legitimation of club cultures in urban policy, resulting in nightlife-specific funding schemes, subsidies and increased professionalisation. This paper scrutinises this institutionalisation of nightlife, posing the question to what extent the institutionalisation of club cultures provides a sustainable pathway forward for nightlife scenes. The paper does so by comparing two highly institutionalised nightlife scenes in Western Europe, Amsterdam and Berlin, as both cities often function as policy examples for local governments around the Global North. Based on document-based policy analysis and semi-structured qualitative interviews with 36 nightclub promoters in Amsterdam and 28 nightclub promoters in Berlin, we seek to investigate how they understand and negotiate these political moves towards institutionalisation. First, we explore how nightlife policy can create conditions that foster nocturnal creativity, for example by providing stability and opportunities, in ways that can (temporarily) free promoters from market demands. Second, we discuss the limits of institutionalisation, analysing the problems that arise as night cultures become embedded in institutional politics. Historically, nightworlds have provided space for subversive cultural genres, transgressive politics, marginalised subcultures and ‘rough’ experiences – aspects that may be impacted by institutionalisation.","The music sector has evolved from a linear value chain based sector to a complex adaptive network, often referred to as the music ecosystem. This ecosystem provides economic, social and cultural value, including the potential to mobilize societal action toward better futures, that include equity and sustainability. However, music ecosystems have faced a plethora of systemic challenges such as inequality, precariousness and lack of diversity - as well as challenges around sustainability and climate. To tackle these, we map, qualify and determine the transformative potential of the so-called “Seeds of Change”.  \r\nSeeds are niche initiatives that have the potential to create transformative change towards a desirable future of the Dutch popular music ecosystem. Therefore, we developed a Transformative Potential Framework, based on three dimensions: 1) creation of a set of desired futures with regards to the systemic challenges 2) the level of the leverage point the Seed targets, and 3) the contribution of the Seed towards the aforementioned desired futures.  \r\nThrough an online survey, we have collected 59 unique Seeds in the Dutch popular music ecosystem which we then categorized into 11 categories, ranging from talent development to technological innovation, and from capacity building to diversity and inclusion initiatives. 21 Seeds target the values & beliefs level of the music ecosystem, have potential multi-level impact, and contribute to the desired futures that were formulated with regards to the systemic issues the Dutch popular music ecosystem is struggling with. The final step is an analysis of appropriate scaling strategies for this set of seeds.","For many autistic individuals, unmasking—the process of ceasing to camouflage autistic traits—is presented as an essential step toward authenticity and well-being. However, this process is fraught with complexity, as unmasking is often met with social resistance, even in environments that claim to be inclusive. This article explores the paradox of unmasking by examining how queer autistic individuals navigate the tension between the need for authentic self-presentation and the structural and interpersonal barriers that make unmasking difficult or even impossible. Using a critical-constructivist Grounded Theory approach, this study draws on qualitative data from semi-structured diaries and interviews with queer autistic participants to investigate the social conditions under which unmasking is attempted, supported, or suppressed. The findings reveal that while unmasking can lead to empowerment within inclusive spaces, it can also be experienced as exhausting to unlearn these habits or constantly navigate what to mask and what not to. Constrained by the combination of gendered and neurotypical norms, unmasking appeared to be often impossible, while still desirable. Even within self-claimed inclusive spaces or with neurodiverse peers, participants often experience pressures to conform to stereotypical expectations. This study highlights the urgent need for deeper structural change and a redefinition of what true inclusivity entails, moving beyond mere tolerance to genuine acceptance of neurodivergent modes of being.\r\n\r\nDit artikel is geschreven voor de Masterclass van Tijdschrift Sociologie 2025","Queer electronic dance parties can be characterized as ‘wild’ experiences of fun and pleasure. Throughout their emergence and in contemporary times, they have contributed to the becoming- queer of many. This research project addresses how queer clubbers negotiate queerness at electronic dance parties in contemporary Amsterdam, drawing on interviews with twelve self-identifying queer clubbers. The interviews revealed that 1) queer electronic dance parties in Amsterdam can contribute to queer world-making, as they provided means to belong, experience, and do queerness; 2) experiencing queerness goes beyond sexuality and gender for many, and it is importantly experienced in doing, while sexuality and gender still seem to be at queer’s definitional center when looking at the ‘outness’ it produces; 3) the contingency and fluidity that is ascribed to queer, and enjoyed by many, can be difficult to negotiate in practice, as the club may provide a space for fluidity but also rigidity when an intelligible performance of queerness is needed to enter a party and find belonging. As was said by Butler: ‘if the term ‘Queer’ is to be a site of collective contestation’ it will have to remain ‘never fully owned’ (1993, p.19). A form of ownership over queerness seems to be visible at times in the Amsterdam queer electronic dance scene, where clubbers are deemed queer “enough” based on appearance. Which can result in an atmosphere that is experienced as normative and intimidating, and could contribute to clubbers performing queerness in a stereotypical way, therefore going against the fluidity that queer ascribes.\r\n\r\nDit artikel is geschreven voor de Masterclass van Tijdschrift Sociologie 2025","Het blijft een heet hangijzer in de muziek: diversiteit op en achter het podium. En programmeurs spelen hierin een cruciale rol. Wanneer programmeurs claimen dat ze niet kijken naar gender, is het resultaat vaak een door mannen gedomineerde line up. \r\nProgrammeurs fungeren als gatekeepers die het culturele aanbod selecteren en zo zowel het economisch voortbestaan van artiesten beïnvloeden als het publieksaanbod vormgeven. Ondanks hun cruciale rol, is hun beslissingsproces vaak ondoorzichtig. Hoewel programmeurs het belang van artistiek-inhoudelijke motieven zullen benadrukken, kunnen meerdere motieven een grote rol spelen en hun keuzes beïnvloed worden door (onder meer) een gender bias. Bovendien zijn gatekeepers’ beslissingen niet louter individueel, maar ingebed in sociale processen, en moeten programmeurs deze legitimeren tegenover diverse actoren. In een dynamische markt waarin continu nieuwe artiesten opkomen, vertrouwen programmeurs vaak op andere gatekeepers om het aanbod te filteren, waarbij informele netwerken en aanbevelingen van peers doorslaggevend kunnen zijn.\r\nOnderdeel van mijn PhD over vrouwelijke professionals in de Nederlandse muziekindustrie, is dit onderzoek naar de boekingsstrategieën en het beslissingsproces van muziekprogrammeurs. Op basis van diepte-interviews met club- en festivalprogrammeurs, exploreer ik hun beroepspraktijk en -ervaringen. Daarbij richt ik mij specifiek op de genderdynamieken binnen hun werkcontext en hoe de programmeurs navigeren in zowel een door mannen gedomineerde industrie, als een door mannen gedomineerde functie. Voortbouwend op een theoretisch kader van sociologische en gendertheorieën over gatekeepers, talent en beslissingsprocessen, en ‘the gendered genius’ ontleed ik hoe programmeurs tot hun keuzes komen.","In de Westerse samenleving speelt emotie een belangrijke rol in hoe mannelijk mannen geacht worden (Reeser & Gottzén, 2018; Meth, 2009; hooks, 2004). Deze studie gaat de connectie na tussen emotie en mannelijkheid door de rol van gendernormen te onderzoeken in de emotieregulatie van stedelijke en rurale mannen in België. Door stedelijke en rurale mannen te vergelijken, konden verschillen nagegaan worden in de spatiale context. Hiervoor werden diepte-interviews afgenomen met acht stedelijke mannen en acht rurale mannen. Uit de analyse kwam een tweeledige gevoelsregel naar voren die vormgaf aan hun emotieregulatie: ten eerste leest de regel dat (sombere) emoties, met uitzondering van boosheid, een zwakte zijn. Bijgevolg betekent dit dat emotionele expressie op een praktische, bijkomstige manier hoort te gebeuren. Hierbij is de expressie terloops, rationeel en oplossingsgericht. Dit script reflecteert de patriarchale definitie van mannelijkheid als kracht, rationaliteit en zelfredzaamheid (Wasylkiw & Clairo, 2018; Velding, 2015). Sterke verschillen waren hier op te merken op geografisch vlak. Rurale mannen hadden conservatievere overtuigingen en internaliseerden de patriarchale norm meer, terwijl stedelijke mannen progressiever waren en de patriarchale norm meer verwierpen. Dit contrast bekrachtigt de huidige polarisering in de Belgische samenleving. Ondanks contestatie van de patriarchale norm, conformeerden ook de stedelingen echter meestal aan de gevoelsregel. Dit patroon bevestigt een cyclus die moeilijk te doorbreken is omdat een non-patriarchale cultuur voor emotionele openheid onder mannen nog niet opgebouwd en genormaliseerd is.  \r\n\r\nDit artikel is geschreven voor de Masterclass van Tijdschrift Sociologie 2025\r\n","Mainstream pornography often relies on socio-cultural stereotypes to deliver its viewers sexual gratification. While extensive research has examined porn consumption patterns, motivations, and effects on sexual satisfaction and behavior, little is known about how individuals actively select pornography and categorize its content. Given the dominance of gendered stereotypes in mainstream porn, understanding the classification processes behind this selection is crucial. In this study we used a Q-sort methodology, in which we asked 81 participants at Lowlands Festival 2024, a setting chosen for its open-minded and diverse audience, to rank 32 pornographic video titles based on sexual attractiveness. To navigate the sensitivity and stigma often surrounding the topic of porn, we utilized a private interview setup where the respondents stayed anonymous: the “Pornfessionbooth”. The results from the Q-sort were analyzed using a principal component analysis and interpreted alongside the qualitative interview insights. Our findings show five distinct clusters of respondents: the ‘Equality Petitioners’, the ‘Authenticity Realists’, the ‘Selective Visualists’, the ‘Traditional Role-Upholders’ and the ‘Fantasy Thrill Seekers’. These clusters represent how individuals classify pornographic content based on gendered pleasure, gendered dominance and power, fantasy versus realism and age considerations. These four key frameworks highlight the underlying mechanisms shaping porn selection and interpretation, therefore providing new insights into different porn classification processes.","Online pornography has expanded into a global cultural industry, reaching hundreds of millions of viewers daily. Despite its magnitude, the genre remains reliant on formulaic narratives that draw on entrenched stereotypes—particularly at the intersection of gender and ethno-racial representation. Existing research has highlighted these patterns through qualitative and quantitative content analyses, yet such approaches face limitations in scope and scalability. This study advances the field by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to a large-scale dataset of over 200 000 Pornhub video entries spanning 10 years (from 2008 to 2018), to investigate how stereotypes are embedded in the platform’s classification systems (tags, categories, and titles). Our findings contribute to both pornography studies and broader sociological debates on algorithmic bias, digital discrimination, and the role of language in encoding social hierarchies. By uncovering the structural mechanisms through which stereotypes persist in online pornography, this study offers a novel methodological and theoretical lens on the intersections of technology, media, and inequality.","While the effects of pornography on youth have been extensively studied, research has primarily focused on consumption rather than how young people interpret and engage with gendered and racialized narratives. Few studies examine how youth critically negotiate, contest, or internalize these stereotypes. This systematic scoping review synthesizes theoretical and empirical insights into how youth (16–25 years) in OECD countries engage with these stereotypes, highlighting dominant conceptual frameworks and methodological gaps.\r\nFollowing the PRISMA-ScR framework, a systematic search across eight academic databases identified 29 studies with conceptual and empirical contributions relevant to our research questions. Unlike prior reviews, this study takes a multidisciplinary approach to mapping how youth interpret pornographic stereotypes, rather than focusing solely on consumption patterns or media effects. The analysis assesses how studies conceptualize youth engagement with pornographic stereotypes, identifying gaps in youth agency, interdisciplinary integration, and longitudinal perspectives.\r\nThe results of this review inform both academic debates and practical interventions, such as porn literacy programs and digital sexual education.\r\nThis study is part of a PhD project funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and is registered on OSF (Mikkers et al., 2024).","Mainstream pornography has a long history of relying on stereotypes to deliver sexual gratification to consumers. Despite mounting evidence that overconsumption of pornographic stereotypes relates to a slew of psychological and societal issues, the popularity of online pornography continues to grow, and to remain staunchly stereotypical. Why so many people from diverse social backgrounds enjoy watching (potentially damaging) stereotypes in pornography remains poorly understood. To address this, we conducted a high-powered experimental study in which we measured heart-rate, eye-tracking, and subjective ratings while individuals were exposed to graphic pornography that varied in terms of the gender stereotypes depicted. We found (i) both men and women preferred pornography with no clear power-dynamic (so-called “vanilla” pornography), (ii) the leas preferred category by both males and females was the so-called anti-stereotype, where there’s a dominant woman and a submissive man, (iii) the aversion to this category of pornography was stronger in women than in men, and (iv) strongest for women with more traditional gender values. (v) Physiologically, we find that when the stimuli became graphic, there was a significant slowing of the heart, consistent with the idea that individuals found the content morally threatening, resulting in a freezing response. Again we (vi) find that this heart-rate slowing to be most pronounced in the anti-stereotype condition, (vii) more pronounced in woman than in men, and (viii) most pronounced in women with traditional views of gender-roles. Taken together, our results provide evidence for how social norms literally get under your skin.","Introduction. Despite greater societal acceptance, sexually and gender diverse (SGD) youth continue to face higher rates of bullying and feel less safe in schools compared to their heterosexual, cisgender peers. These disparities are driven by hetero- and cisnormative norms in schools, but it remains unclear how school policies impact these issues. This study identifies latent classes of school policies in the Netherlands and explores their potential role in moderating disparities in victimization and social unsafety based on sexual orientation and gender modality. \r\nMethods. Cross-sectional data from 142 management employees at 48 Dutch secondary schools were analyzed using Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to identify the structure of 23 school policies. These policies addressed inclusion, SGD-based respect, discrimination prevention, behavioral discipline, performance-based respect, and staff/parent incentives. \r\nResults. LCA revealed five latent policy classes: (1) high on behavioral discipline, low on inclusion; (2) moderate across several dimensions, low on staff/parent incentives; (3) high on inclusion and discrimination prevention, moderate on SGD-based respect; (4) high on inclusion, moderate on staff/parent incentives; and (5) high across all categories except behavioral discipline. Schools with stricter disciplinary policies were generally less inclusive of SGD issues, while those with moderate behavioral discipline were more inclusive. \r\nConclusion. This study highlights variations in school policies and suggests that while inclusion and discrimination prevention may be prioritized, SGD-based respect remains moderate. A follow-up study will investigate how these policy classes influence disparities, informing more effective interventions.","Ondanks dat in Nederland op nationaal niveau en lokaal niveau wordt geïnvesteerd om LGBTQ+ discriminatie te verminderen en de acceptatie te bevorderen, is de emancipatie nog lang niet voltooid. Zowel LGBTQ+ personen als een aanzienlijk deel van de lokale overheden benadrukken daarbij het belang van lokaal beleid om acceptatie te vergroten. \r\nWetenschappelijk onderzoek naar de effectiviteit van antidiscriminatiebeleid is echter gelimiteerd, op twee manieren. Ten eerste richten eerdere studies zich vooral op nationale beleidskaders of bredere culturele normen. Maar er zijn grote verschillen binnen landen in zowel het bestaande beleid als de ervaren acceptatie van LHBTI+ personen, die zo over het hoofd worden gezien. Ten tweede richt bestaand onderzoek zich voornamelijk op percepties van beleid onder LHBTI+ personen. Hoewel of beleid landt bij de doelgroep evident belangrijk is, is het ook belangrijk om te weten welk beleid er eigenlijk bestaat volgens beleidsmakers. \r\nIn de huidige studie onderzoeken we hoe het lokale antidiscriminatiebeleid zoals gerapporteerd door beleidsmakers en het beleid zoals ervaren door LHBTI+ personen de ervaren acceptatie onder LHBTI+ personen beïnvloedt. Daarbij gebruiken we fijnmazige metingen van het gerapporteerde beleid door beleidsmakers – niet alleen of er antidiscriminatiebeleid is, maar ook welke maatregelen er worden genomen en of er prioriteit aan de LHBTI+ groepen wordt gegeven. Daarnaast is onze studie uniek omdat we gebruikmaken van een steekproef van meer dan 2,000 LHBTI+ respondenten in Nederland, waardoor we ook kunnen onderzoeken of er verschillen zijn tussen bepaalde groepen, bijvoorbeeld tussen non-binaire mensen versus homoseksuele mannen.","Muslims are generally portrayed as opposing homosexuality; however, recent studies have shown that the relation between Muslims and homosexuality is more complex. In this study, we try to further understand how Islamic religiosity shapes Muslims’ (multilayered) perspectives on sexual orientation (and connectedly sexuality and gender identity) in the Netherlands, while taking an intersectional perspective particularly regarding people’s gender. Applying this approach, the study endeavors to provide a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of how Muslims follow and/or negotiate religious interpretations, discourses and beliefs with regard to homosexuality, and which sources one draws from. Drawing on 35 in-depth interviews with Dutch Muslims in a racialized context, we find that (conflicting) religious interpretations, respect for one`s free choice, and Islamophobia play an important role in Muslims’ perspectives on homosexuality, both in terms of challenging and reconciling societal expectations and religious teachings","This study investigates how sexual orientation and gender identity and expression (SOGIE) factors and identity disclosure intersect to influence perceptions of professionalism in the workplace. We investigated how social identities influence professional evaluations based on the status-belief theory. Using a factorial vignette design, we manipulated gender (woman, man), sexual orientation (heterosexual, gay/lesbian, bisexual), gender expression (feminine, gender-neutral, masculine), and sexual orientation disclosure (full disclosure, selective disclosure, full concealment) within fictitious employee profiles. A representative sample of 376 UK participants evaluated six randomized profiles on perceived professionalism. The results reveal significant biases against LGB employees, particularly those who fully disclose their sexual orientation. Men with feminine expressions faced harsher penalties, while women experienced more flexibility in expressing non-conforming gender traits. These findings underscore how norms around gender and sexuality shape professional evaluations and perpetuate workplace inequities.","Sex work was decriminalized in Belgium on June 1, 2022. Since December 1, 2024, a labor framework has allowed sex workers to work as self-employed or salaried employees. Yet sex work is often hidden, concealed and kept secret: few sex workers are completely outed. Their work is often hidden from their loved ones for fear of rejection, break-up or judgment. It is hidden from administrations and institutions to avoid administrative and financial sanctions. It is also hidden from homeowners for fear of being refused accommodation. Sex workers are reluctant to report sexual assaults, violence or scams linked to their activity, for fear of both being deprived of their rights and of having their activity revealed. Many sex workers in Belgium still live in secrecy, compartmentalizing their lives to deal with the stigma they face. Based on these field observations gathered during my two years of research for my doctoral thesis in criminology (ULB), this presentation will question the notions of coming out and secrecy in the professional careers of sex workers. Using sociologist Howard Becker's concept of “deviant careers”, I'll examine how professional careers in sex work are still kept secret, parallel, on the margins of society, and therefore still deviant\".","The notion of professional identity, as it appears in sociological literature, refers both to the individual's integration of a series of collective dimensions linked to the group to which he or she belongs and to the organisational and institutional framework and the ‘subjective’ interpretation and reinterpretation of these collective dimensions. In this context, ‘the relationship between inherited identities, accepted or rejected by individuals, and targeted identities, in continuity or rupture with previous identities, depends on the modes of recognition by legitimate institutions and their agents in direct contact with subjects’ (Dubar 2022). \r\nOur contribution aims to examine the deployment of the professional identity of a group of sex workers in the context of a transformation of legal norms relating to prostitution and sex work - in this case, in the context of ‘decriminalisation’ in Belgium between 2023 and 2025. We base our study on the testimonies of 15 sex workers in Brussels and Charleroi, who work as ‘independents’ in very different contexts and whom we have followed since 2020. \r\nThis longitudinal approach enables us to highlight the effects of decriminalisation on self-affirmation as a ‘sex worker’ and on the relationship with clients and their entourage, as reflected in the changes in their testimonies. Using the framework of professional identity analysis, we discuss the effects of decriminalisation on the ‘negotiation’ of professional identity, paying particular attention to the material dimension, which remains preponderant in the testimonies.","Escorts sustain their livelihood through the provision of sexual services advertised on online platforms. They physically meet clients in often unfamiliar locations, such as hotels or the client’s home. Meeting clients in unknown locations exposes escorts to various risks, including physical violence, stalking, and extortion. Surprisingly, few participants in this study disclose such victimisation. Instead, they underscore the varied safety measures applied before, during, and after a date. Escorts thoroughly screen clients before meeting them; they check rooms for hidden cameras, share their live location with friends or chauffeurs, and report untrustworthy or violent clients on an online blacklist to caution other escorts.  \r\nThis presentation discusses the results of 28 in-depth interviews with cisgender female escorts working in the Netherlands and Belgium. The focal point of this discussion revolves around the firsthand experiences of this hidden and hard-to-reach group concerning safety during this often-called high-risk profession. Further, we zoom in on various safety measures these women implement to ensure their safety. Acknowledging the disparate legal frameworks in both nations, the presentation also explores the repercussions of regulation in the Netherlands and decriminalisation in Belgium. The presentation provides a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by female escorts. It offers insights for policymakers and support professionals to enhance the safety and well-being of sex workers.","The so-called ‘prostitution wars’ risk harming the quality of the research that allows for a better understanding of what is happening and consequently could inform policy.  The debate about which outcomes follow from certain types of legislation and enforcement has probably sparked the fiercest battles. In the past decades, scholars have begun to unravel aspects of the functioning of prostitution markets more rigidly with cutting-edge statistical techniques.  \r\nThe gaps in our understanding of the connections and mechanisms linking policies to the number of sex workers, the quality of their working conditions and the potential harms associated with the sex industry are wanting. Nevertheless, the descriptive research available is suggestive, and the few recent high-quality studies provide us with the beginnings of an answer. Overall, it is safe to conclude that policies, writ large, substantially affect sex workers' safety and health, the number of sex workers, and the impact on society. We summarise the available evidence, also identifying shortcomings and substantial gaps in our knowledge.  \r\nOne field where a handful of scattered but well-designed studies seem to allow some preliminary conclusions is that criminalisation may reduce the size of the market but worsen the risks and perils for the remaining sex workers. The opposite appears to happen in the case of decriminalisation: an increase in the supply of the number of sex workers, but overall better working conditions and fewer risks.  \r\nThese conclusions, however, remain preliminary, given the overall scarcity of well-designed studies and the lack of reliable data.","In the Netherlands, rising ageism and labor shortages have amplified the role of informal caregivers, who increasingly assume responsibilities once handled by professional care services. Despite informal caregivers growing importance in today’s society, welfare policies often prioritize paid employment as the ideal form of social participation, neglecting the value of informal caregiving and overlooking the reality that many welfare recipients are unable to participate in the labor market.\r\nWhile abundant research exists on the role of informal caregiving in Western societies, its significance for welfare recipients remains understudied. This study addresses this gap through 40 semi-structured interviews conducted across three municipalities. Through the lens of Social Reproduction Theory, the research provides insights into how personal circumstances, policies, and social norms intersect to shape the meaning and value recipients derive from caregiving. \r\nOur findings reveal the duality of informal caregiving's value for recipients: while it can provide meaning and fulfillment, it can also limit their ability to pursue employment. A particularly important aspect of this study is the experience of single parents, predominantly mothers, who provide intensive caregiving for their disabled children. These parents receive benefits for extended periods and find it nearly impossible to transition out of the system. Despite these hardships, many view their caregiving as a valuable contribution to society—a contribution that is often overlooked by society or even penalized by existing policies. This underscores the need for policy reform to broaden the definition of valuable work to include caregiving activities, recognizing them as legitimate contributions, and, more importantly, finding ways to support caregiving recipients accordingly.","In Dutch policies like the passende zorg framework, informal carers are given a prominent position in relieving the pressure on professional care related to an aging population and workforce shortage. At the same time, such policy frameworks also acknowledge the burdens on informal carers and the need to alleviate these. In this study we bring this policy paradox into dialogue with the lived experiences of informal carers of people with acquired brain injury and people with physical disabilities who receive long term care. Innovative of this research is our narrative approach. Narrative methodology is eligible for studying both the meaning and consequences of policy, as policymaking entails the creation of selective and persuasive narratives, intended to guide people’s behavior in specific directions. Their plots are powerful as they bring forward culturally shared ways of understanding societal issues and have real life consequences. To bring these into dialogue with lived experiences, we studied books from the collection (‘patientervaringsverhalen.nl’) that provides rich, first-person narratives about care. Policy documents and books were analyzed with storyline analysis as developed by Murray and Sools. This method addresses narrative meaning-making on the personal, interactional and socio-cultural level and is particularly designed to study narratives as holistic meaning units, by analyzing and connecting different story elements. Consequently, different plot structures can be identified across data, to demonstrate friction in meaning-making within and between different narratives. We share preliminary results of our ongoing work and reflect on our methodology.","A large part of the help in the Netherlands is given by relatives or friends of people with health disabilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw indications that during a situation of reduced professional care, not all caregivers start giving more help: some do not change or provide less help. It is, however, unclear to what extent these findings apply to future spells of reduced professional care, which are likely to occur due to increasing labor shortages in the care sector. Furthermore, it is unclear how these spells may affect specific groups of caregivers, such as women. It is feared that the pressure will mainly fall on them. \r\nPrevious research has shown that the Informal Care Model (ICM) is a useful tool to explain how caregivers respond to changing circumstances, related to need to provide care, its barriers and care beliefs. However, it is not known whether the same characteristics play a role in informal care by men as in women. Moreover, self-reported changes in informal caregiving may be biased. With a longitudinal design, this bias can be reduced, allowing us to determine with more certainty whether ICM-characteristics in men and women are associated with increases or decreases in the provision of informal care. \r\nIn this paper we investigate, based on the LISS panel, gender differences in changes in informal caregiving intensity. We run multi nominal regression models. If it turns out that barriers and beliefs play a much less important role in women than in men, women may take on too much informal tasks more easily. In that case, policy aimed at strengthening informal care should pay extra attention to gender differences.","The negative impact of caregiving on mental health and well-being is well-established. Previous studies found that caregiver burden depends on the location of caregiving, namely whether it occurs inside or outside the caregivers household. In this study, we delve deeper into the differences in caregiver burden by caregiving location, in order to understand how the characteristics of inside- and outside-household caregiving arrangements – namely by the intensity of caregiving, the number of tasks, and the motivations to provide care –  relate to caregiving burden. \r\nUsing multi-level models on Dutch caregiving data from 2020 collected in the LISS panel (4,846 caregiving relationships of 2,648 caregivers), we found that inside compared to outside household care was related to higher intensity of caregiving, more tasks provided, and the perceived obligation to provide care. These factors similarly contribute to the understanding the driving forces behind caregiving burden. These findings indicate that it is not the location per se that explains higher levels of burden but rather the differences that come with caring for someone in their household. We argue that this supports the claim that to account for future developments of caregiving, more detailed information on the exact caregiving situation – instead of focusing on inside and outside household care alone – is needed.","Objectives - The aging population and increasing care demands intensify the burden on informal caregivers, particularly for individuals with dementia. This study examines the relationship between assistive technologies and caregiver burden, as well as perseverance time, for caregivers of community-dwelling individuals with dementia.\r\nDesign - An online survey measured objective burden (length of caregiving in years/months and weekly hours spent on caregiving tasks) and subjective burden (experienced burden, quality of life, caregiving satisfaction, and perseverance time) using validated instruments. Data were collected on caregiver and care recipient demographics, housing and neighborhood characteristics, the presence of assistive technologies, and preferences for non-present technologies.\r\nSetting and Participants - The study included 349 informal caregivers of individuals with dementia living at home. Participants either cohabited with or lived within a 10-minute travel distance of the care recipient.\r\nMethods - Multivariate logistic regression models examined the associations between assistive technologies in the care recipient’s home, caregiver burden, and perseverance time, accounting for residential, environmental, and demographic factors. The association between the most desired yet unavailable assistive technology and perceived perseverance time extension was analyzed. \r\nResults - A greater number of assistive technologies was associated with higher odds of achieving above-median CarerQol-7D scores and perseverance times. Also, caregivers identified various assistive technologies they perceived as potentially extending perseverance time by one month.\r\nConclusions - Assistive technologies help reduce caregiver burden and may support sustained at-home care for individuals with dementia, highlighting their potential to ease caregiver strain and promote sustainable aging in place.","Due to various societal developments, more people will become working informal caregivers (WICs) in the near future. Given that work and informal care, independently and in interrelation, are time- and energy-demanding, WICs (temporarily or permanently) reduce their working hours, choose less demanding jobs, and/or chase career progression to a lesser degree in order to cope with the combination. It is likely that these strategies will negatively affect income of WICs over time. This is why we set out to discover: what are the long-term consequences of starting informal care on working hours and income in individuals who were contractually employed when they started informal caregiving? To answer this research question, we merged SCP-data on informal care (2019) with Statistics Netherlands data on working hours and income (2012-2019). We looked at individuals who were not providing informal care in 2012 and followed them until 2019 and thus looked at possible labor outcomes across 8 years in those who started to provide informal care during these years. For this, we transformed SCP-data to act like panel data, and conducted fixed effects regression analyses on the merged data. In the analyses, starting to provide informal care was the independent, and working hours and income the dependent variables. In all analyses, we controlled for period effects, young children within the household, and life phase. Subgroup analyses were performed and all analyses were split according to gender of the WIC. Currently, the analyses are being finalized and results will become available at the conference.","Een ziekenhuisopname vormt vaak een scharniermoment, niet alleen voor de zorgvrager maar ook voor diens mantelzorger. Mantelzorgers nemen hierbij diverse rollen op: zo kunnen ze de brug vormen tussen de thuissituatie en het ziekenhuis, zorgen voor rust en continuïteit voor de zorgvrager tijdens zijn / haar verblijf. Tegelijk gaat de opname vaak gepaard met stress en onzekerheden bij zowel de zorgvrager als de mantelzorger. \r\nSteeds meer ziekenhuizen ontwikkelen een beleid rond mantelzorgparticipatie en ondersteuning. Dit wordt aangestuurd door een grotere belangstelling voor persoonsgerichte zorg, patiënt- en familietevredenheid en het tekort aan zorgpersoneel. Voor personeel is het betrekken van mantelzorgers niet altijd vanzelfsprekend, en kan dit rolconflicten en nieuwe uitdagingen brengen.\r\nIn deze bijdrage stellen we de resultaten voor van een kwalitatief verkennend onderzoek in een Gents ziekenhuis dat recent een beleid ontwikkelde en uitrolde rond mantelzorgparticipatie. Hoe ervaren de drie partijen binnen de triade (zorgvragers – mantelzorgers – professionals) de mantelzorgparticipatie en -ondersteuning in de ziekenhuiscontext? Via semi-gestructureerde interviews met 9 mantelzorgers, 4 zorgvragers en 13 professionele zorgverleners brachten we perspectieven, aandachtspunten en succesfactoren voor triadisch werken in kaart.\r\nGebaseerd op deze resultaten en een verkenning van good practices in andere Vlaamse ziekenhuizen formuleren we een aantal concrete good practices en aanbevelingen voor triadisch werken in de ziekenhuiscontext. Het onderzoek toont dat het actief vormgeven van de relatie tussen zorgvrager, mantelzorger en professionele hulpverleners, kan bijdragen tot een hogere ervaren kwaliteit van zorg en voordelen voor alle partijen.","Door de groeiende vraag naar langdurige zorg krijgt ook de familie als bron van zorg steeds meer aandacht. Voor volwassen kinderen van ouders met een zorgbehoefte kan dit uitdagend zijn, omdat zij vaak willen zorgen, maar barrières ervaren door lange reistijden of verantwoordelijkheden voor eigen families of betaald werk. Als er broers of zussen zijn wordt vaak samen overwogen wie voor een ouder zorgt. Dit zijn vooral dochters en kinderen met minder barrieres. Dit roept de vraag op hoe de zorgpatronen van volwassen kinderen en hun broers of zussen zijn veranderd als gevolg van maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen zoals kleiner wordende families of de terugtrekkende welvaartsstaat. Daarom onderzoekt deze studie of de invloed van kenmerken van volwassen kinderen of van hun broers of zussen op zorggebruik is veranderd. Deze studie is gebaseerd op twee aanvullende studies van de Longitudinal Ageing Study of Amsterdam (LASA): In 2001 werd hiermee informele zorg binnen families in kaart gebracht en in 2023 werd dit herhaald als onderdeel van het FAMCARE project. Alle families met ten minste twee kinderen waarin de ouders thuis wonen zijn geïncludeerd in deze studie (2001: N=186 ouders en 702 kinderen, 2023: 123 ouders en 317 kinderen). Voorlopige resultaten laten zien dat volwassen kinderen zowel in 2001 als in 2023 vaker zorg geven wanneer hun broers of zussen ook zorgen. Daarnaast geven zij ook vaker zorg als zij dicht bij hun ouders wonen en broers of zussen verder weg. Verschillen in zorgpatronen tussen zonen en dochters zijn in 2023 licht afgenomen.","Met de toenemende vergrijzing en diversiteit groeien de zorg- en ondersteuningsnoden van ouderen met een migratieachtergrond. Het bieden van zorg aan deze groep vormt vaak een uitdaging voor zorg- en welzijnsprofessionals. Ouderen met een migratieachtergrond maken door diverse barrières weinig gebruik van professionele zorg- en welzijnsdiensten. Ook worden mantelzorgers weinig betrokken als volwaardige zorgpartners, dit terwijl ze voor veel ouderen met een migratieachtergrond verantwoordelijk zijn voor de zorg van hun dierbaren. Dit benadrukt de noodzaak aan meer competenties in divers-sensitieve zorg en mantelzorgbetrokkenheid bij zorg- en welzijnsprofessionals. \r\nBinnen het Erasmus+ DI.S.C.O.P.M.B. project werd via de ‘Double Diamond’-methodiek een leerpakket ontwikkeld om competenties in divers-sensitieve zorg te versterken bij zorg- en welzijnsprofessionals en studenten. Het proces doorliep vier fasen: Discover, Define, Develop en Deliver. Het leerpakket bestaat uit 4 hoofdstukken: (1) persoonsgerichte zorg in diversiteit, (2) barrières in toegang tot professionele gezondheids- en welzijnszorg, (3) stereotypen en vooroordelen, en (4) divers-sensitieve communicatie. Verschillende kennisbronnen zoals wetenschappelijke literatuur, ervaringskennis, storytelling-interviews en best practices werden geïntegreerd. \r\nHet leerpakket werd getest en geëvalueerd in de partnerlanden door 276 deelnemers, waaronder master- en bachelorstudenten in zorgopleidingen en professionals. Daarnaast werden in de partnerlanden ook focusgroepen georganiseerd met ouderen met een migratieachtergrond, hun mantelzorgers en zorg- en welzijnsprofessionals. Hierbij werd ingezoomd op ervaringen met professionele gezondheids- en welzijnszorg en persoonsgerichte, divers-sensitieve aanpak. \r\nTijdens de presentatie worden het ontwikkelingsproces, de inhoud en de resultaten van het leerpakket en de resultaten van de focusgroepen besproken.","De toenemende levensverwachting in Europa heeft geleid tot een verschuiving van dodelijke naar invaliderende aandoeningen bij ouderen, waardoor zorg een cruciale rol speelt in het behoud van hun welbevinden. Informele zorg door partners en kinderen vormt de kern van mantelzorg, maar dit wordt steeds vaker aangevuld met formele en private zorg. Deze complexe zorgnetwerken brengen nieuwe uitdagingen met zich mee, vooral met betrekking tot de psychologische impact op zowel zorgverleners als zorgontvangers. Deze studie vult twee kennislacunes in. Ten eerste wordt onderzocht hoe het functioneren van het zorgnetwerk van invloed is op het welbevinden van de zorgontvanger. Waar eerdere onderzoeken zich vaak afzonderlijk richtten op zorgverleners en zorgontvangers, wordt in deze studie o.a. onderzocht in welke mate de belasting van de zorgverlener het welbevinden van de zorgontvanger beïnvloedt. Daarnaast worden aspecten zoals conflicten, regie over de zorg en voldoende zorg, meegenomen in de analyse. Dit wordt onderzocht in twee tijdsgewrichten (2001 en 2023). Demografische en beleidsmatige veranderingen, zoals het beleid van \"langer thuis wonen,\" hebben de druk op informele zorg vergroot. Tegelijkertijd is de beschikbaarheid van mantelzorg afgenomen door dalende geboortecijfers en veranderende gezinsstructuren. De studie onderzoekt of het perspectief van de zorgverlener in de periode 2001–2023 belangrijker is geworden. Met data van de Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA), die zowel de zorgverleners (partners en kinderen) als de zorgontvangers omvat, biedt dit onderzoek inzichten in hoe zorgnetwerken het welbevinden beïnvloeden.","De vergrijzing doet de vraag naar mantelzorg toenemen. Partners zijn de eerste aanbieders van zorg wanneer iemand gezondheidsproblemen heeft. In dit onderzoek wordt onderzocht in hoeverre het verlenen van informele zorg aan of het ontvangen van informele zorg van de partner van invloed is op de tevredenheid met de partnerrelatie. Er worden tegengestelde hypothesen geformuleerd. Een negatief effect is te verwachten omdat een informele zorgsituatie stress kan veroorzaken en de gelijkwaardigheid tussen partners kan verminderen, wat voor beide de relatietevredenheid kan schaden. Een positief effect is te verwachten omdat het verlenen van zorg vaak leidt tot een hechtere relatie met degene die zorg krijgt en omdat dankbaarheid jegens de partner bij de ontvanger van zorg van hulp de relatietevredenheid ten goede kan komen. Zestien waves van Nederlandse paneldata (LISS), verzameld tussen 2008 en 2023, werden gecombineerd. De gegevens omvatten 84.306 observaties van 16.205 unieke respondenten; 2.631 observaties registreerden de zorgverlening aan de partner en 2.289 observaties registreerden het ontvangen van zorg van de partner. Voorlopige analyses met fixed effects laten zien dat relatietevredenheid negatief gerelateerd is aan het verlenen van partnerzorg, maar positief gerelateerd aan het ontvangen van partnerzorg. Vrouwen die zorg verlenen aan hun partner vertonen een grotere vermindering van de relatietevredenheid dan mannen. Het effect van het ontvangen van zorg van de partner verschilt niet tussen mannen en vrouwen.","De vergrijzing en afnemende publieke zorg hebben in de afgelopen decennia geleid tot een grotere afhankelijkheid van informele zorg. Kinderen zijn vaak, naast de partner, zorgverleners voor hun ouders. Dit onderzoek vergelijkt de zorgsituatie en zorglast van kinderen in 2001 en 2023 met data uit de Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA). Het doel is inzicht te krijgen in hoe veranderingen in demografie en beleid de zorglast beïnvloeden.\r\nFactoren zoals kleinere gezinnen, hogere arbeidsparticipatie en langer thuis wonen maken de zorg voor een ouder mogelijk complexer, terwijl een betere gezondheid een positief effect kan hebben op zorglast. Deze studie onderzoekt determinanten van zorglast, zoals zorgintensiteit, secundaire stressoren (bijv. werkdruk) en positieve (emotionele steun) en negatieve (conflicten) aspecten van hulp van anderen worden.\r\nWe onderzoeken in welke mate determinanten van zorglast zijn veranderd tussen 2001 en 2023, en we veronderstellen dat de impact van deze determinanten op zorglast is toegenomen door minder keuzemogelijkheden en een groter gevoel van verplichting om te zorgen door beleidsveranderingen \r\nVoorlopige resultaten tonen aan dat in 2023 in vergelijking met 2001 zorgontvangers een betere fysieke gezondheid hadden, ondanks een hogere leeftijd. Kinderen hadden minder broers of zussen, werkten vaker en deelden zorg minder vaak. De zorgintensiteit was lager en de zorglast was gelijk in 2023 in vergelijking met 2001. Contact, behoefte aan hulp en conflicten hadden in 2023 een grotere impact op de zorglast dan in 2001.\r\nDit onderzoek benadrukt de noodzaak van beleid dat zorgdeling tussen familieleden faciliteert en ondersteunt om de toekomstige zorgdruk te verlichten.","In het hoger onderwijs combineren veel studenten hun studie met de zorg voor een familielid, vriend of buur met een ziekte, beperking, psychische kwetsbaarheid, ouderdom of verslavingsproblematiek. Deze student-mantelzorgers zijn vaak onzichtbaar en missen daardoor erkenning en ondersteuning. Het alliantieproject van de Hogeschool Gent (HOGENT) en de Erasmus hogeschool Brussel (EhB) onderzocht de noden van deze studenten en de bereidheid van het onderwijspersoneel om hen te ondersteunen. \r\nVia kwantitatieve bevragingen deelden 105 student-mantelzorgers hun ervaringen over de impact van hun zorgrol op studeren en het studentenleven, evenals hun behoefte aan ondersteunende onderwijs- en examenmaatregelen. Daarnaast gaven 113 onderwijsgevenden inzicht in hun houding tegen mantelzorgvriendelijke maatregelen.  De resultaten tonen een negatieve impact van mantelzorg op studeren en een brede bereidheid bij onderwijsgevenden om ondersteunende maatregelen toe te passen.\r\nNaast het onderzoek werden verschillende sensibiliseringsacties opgezet, zoals de campagne ‘Mooie woorden en beelden’, waarin studenten en lesgevers woorden en beelden inzonden die voor hen mantelzorg symboliseerde. \r\nHet project concludeert dat een mantelzorgvriendelijk onderwijsbeleid onmisbaar is. Dit vereist dat een hoger onderwijsinstelling eerst een duidelijke visie ontwikkelt, waarna de opleidingen deze visie kunnen vertalen naar concrete maatregelen die aansluiten bij de specifieke noden en mogelijkheden.","\r\nThis research examines the preferences and challenges patients with a migration background face when making medical decisions. Based on existing literature, two hypotheses are formulated: First, patients with a migration background may prefer to limit or conceal stressful medical information, differing from EU healthcare norms that emphasize direct and honest communication. Second, non-EU migrants often involve their families more in health-related decisions. Additionally, other sociodemographic characteristics and the specifics of the clinical case are considered.\r\nTo test these hypotheses, a vignette survey is developed featuring two hypothetical scenarios describing clinical consultations regarding cancer and depression diagnoses, with the latter varying in severity. Respondents (potential patients) indicate their preferences for family involvement and information disclosure using adaptations of existing scales by Ende (1989), Alden (2015, 2018), and Müller-Engelsmann (2013). Furthermore, detailed sociodemographic and economic information is collected.\r\nThe survey is part of The Social Study (TSS) and aims to gather data from a representative sample of the Belgian population aged 16 years or older in 2024, with approximately 1,500 respondents. Regression analyses are conducted to examine the effect of migration background on preferences for family involvement and information disclosure across the two vignettes, accounting for other sociodemographic and economic characteristics as well as the severity of the medical condition in the depression vignette. This research highlights the importance of culturally sensitive healthcare practices that address the needs of migrant populations in Belgium’s medical decision-making processes.\r\n","Context: Women present for abortion at widely varying gestational ages because of myriad barriers they may face along their trajectory and because of inequitable access to abortion care. Mapping women’s trajectories to abortion care and identifying barriers experienced within can inform policy decisions on abortion care.\r\nMethods: A structured survey was completed by 498 women presenting for abortion at five (Dutch-speaking) abortion centers in Belgium. Bivariate analyses examined differences in the duration of abortion trajectories, and associations with experienced barriers were assessed.\r\nResults: Women who presented later significantly took more time in the first stages of the abortion trajectory. 42.0% of the respondents weren’t able to recognize the symptoms they experienced as pregnancy symptoms, and 36.7% didn’t experience any typical pregnancy symptoms. 35.2% consulted a/their GP before they contacted the abortion center. For more than 95%, the choice for abortion is sure to entirely determined at the first consultation, around 50% of respondents indicated that it was still a difficult choice to make. About 40.1 % reported feeling ashamed for choosing abortion, and 38.5% reported being disappointed in themselves for this reason. Fear of the procedure and associated pain was also seen as a major barrier by 45.4%. \r\nConclusion: This study highlights the multifaceted barriers women face along their trajectories to abortion care in Flanders, Belgium. The results underscore the need for improved accessibility to abortion care, enhanced reproductive health education, and supportive policies that address both the psychological and practical barriers to obtaining abortion care.\r\n","Diabetes is an increasingly significant global health issue, affecting approximately 74 million adults and 300,000 children and adolescents across Europe. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that diabetes-related deaths could double between 2005 and 2030, primarily due to an aging population and rising risk factors such as obesity and sedentary lifestyles. By 2045, it is projected that one in ten Europeans will be living with diabetes.\r\nAs a chronic condition, diabetes requires long-term management to prevent complications. Nevertheless, healthcare systems are facing pressure from rising demand and workforce shortages. Informal care networks (family, friends, and communities) are becoming increasingly vital in supporting diabetes patients. While diabetes is primarily a physical illness, social and behavioral factors significantly influence disease management, coping mechanisms, and patient support. Social networks can promote healthier lifestyles, enhance access to information and resources, and provide both emotional and practical assistance.\r\nDespite the acknowledged importance of social networks, research on their role in diabetes care has yielded mixed results. Some studies indicate that strong social relationships can improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of diabetes, while others find no significant correlation. This study aims to explore these inconsistencies by investigating the impact of social capital (both bonding and bridging) on diabetes prevalence, the likelihood of diagnosis, and disease management. By utilizing objective measures such as biomarkers and cross-national data (SHARE), this research seeks to clarify the role of social networks in diabetes care and contribute to a better understanding of effective support structures.\r\n","Regular physical activity (PA) benefits various health outcomes, but children and adolescents in single-parent families conduct on average less PA than their peers in two-parent families. Earlier research, however, finds cross-national variation in the association between living with a single parent and the amount of PA in European adolescents. The aim of this study is to examine whether cross-national variation in national levels of PA promotion explains the cross-national variation in the association between living with a single parent and the amount of PA in European adolescents. We hypothesise that this association is weaker in countries with higher national levels of PA promotion. We use data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey, distributed among 11 to 15-year-olds in Europe in 2017/2018, and complement these data with WHO data on national-level PA promotion policies. Mixed multilevel linear and logistic regressions are conducted with respondents clustered in countries and schools and PA outcomes operationalised both as conducting vigorous physical activity (VPA) at least four times a week, and as the number of days a week conducting at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Our results demonstrate the association between living with a single parent and VPA and MVPA, and how it varies cross-nationally, but also indicate that higher national levels of PA promotion neither increase VPA and MVPA, nor moderate the association between living with a single parent and VPA and MVPA in European adolescents.","Several Dutch educational institutions have adopted the Positive Health (PH) approach to guide and support their students. PH refers to the ability to adapt and self-manage in response to social, physical, and emotional challenges. Structured into six dimensions, it covers mental and physical health, social functioning, and tools for reflection and discussion on these topics. Originally developed for medical contexts, the majority of research on PH still focuses on healthcare domain.\r\nThis study explores whether PH enhances different aspects of student well-being and resilience, under what conditions, and what benefits or barriers exist. Grounded in Sen’s capability approach and resilience theories, we employ a convergent mixed-methods design, integrating survey data and 16 interviews with students and teachers from a Dutch higher education institution that has used PH in student mentoring for three years.\r\nPreliminary findings highlight PH’s potential to initiate conversations on difficult topics and enhance students’ ability to reflect on their health and stressors. The results underscore the teacher’s role as a key moderator between PH and well-being. PH topics—such as mental health and financial stability—extend beyond traditional student-teacher interactions, posing challenges. While PH can reduce inequalities when teachers are well-equipped, gaps in teachers’ skills may disadvantage some students.\r\nTherefore, we recommend investing in teachers’ competencies and ensuring flexible student-teacher pairings. Additionally, in practice, PH conversations often focus on problems rather than strengths, contradicting its core philosophy. To maximize benefits, a greater emphasis on the positive aspects of students' functioning should be encouraged.","Transitioning into parenthood is a significant life event that can influence subjective well-being, with timing potentially playing a key role. Although deviations from normative parenthood timing are increasingly accepted, norms surrounding parenthood persist in the Netherlands. Descriptive norms (what most people do) are often used as a proxy for prescriptive norms (what most people think should be done), though they are conceptually distinct and function differently. Previous research found a gap of 1.5 to 4 years between the ideal and actual age of parenthood across 29 European countries, raising questions about distinct impacts of each norm on well-being. The present study explored whether deviations from descriptive and prescriptive parenthood age norms are related to well-being namely life satisfaction (LS) and self-esteem (SE), and if these associations differ by gender. Using the Dutch LISS panel (2023, N = 979, Age = 25-50), we defined off-time parenthood via generalized additive models and ran multiple linear regressions with main effects, control variables, and gender interactions. The results show that early parenthood, compared to (prescriptive) on-time parenthood, was associated with lower LS (b = -0.24, p = .024), but this effect disappeared once control variables were included. SE was not significantly related to deviations from prescriptive norms. Deviating from descriptive norms was not significantly related to either LS or SE. We will discuss implications of these results within the Dutch context, exploring how parenthood timing norms did not have the expected impact on well-being, and exploring how future research could further examine these relationships.","Caregiver wellbeing is a growing concern in ageing societies with rising care demands, as individuals increasingly care for family and friends with health problems, while childcare too comprises a significant share of unpaid care for many. While caregiving can be enriching, it often conflicts with employment or other activities, creating strains in the short-term, but also cumulatively over time. Strains to wellbeing might limit the ability to care or leave caregivers in need of care themselves, particularly when care involvement is heavy. Furthermore, since women typically have care-heavier life-courses, existing inequalities will likely widen as care needs increase. Conversely, having accumulated ‘care capital’ including care-related experience and skills, may allow for better adaptation to care demands, resulting in less ‘wear-and-tear’ over time. Becoming more equipped might further open room for fulfillment with the caregiver role, impacting wellbeing positively. Our study thus examines to what extent unpaid caregiving impacts subjective wellbeing for women and men, considering differences in accumulated care-heaviness. As optimal wellbeing includes high life satisfaction and positive affect, we include both measures. Drawing on role-conflict and life-course theories, and taking an integrated perspective including both informal-and childcare as distinct yet interconnected types of care, we answer (1)to what extent proximate caregiving, including informal care and childcare, influences life satisfaction and happiness for women and men; and (2)how this varies by accumulated care-heaviness. We use retrospective survey data from the Netherlands on informal caregiving, combined with annual childrearing and wellbeing data from the LISS Panel, and run fixed-effects regression models.","Increases in female labor force participation and female outperformance of men when it comes to educational attainment are two key structural forces in Western societies. They go along with increasing social norms in families for men to participate in housework and childcare, challenging the long-standing male breadwinner norm. This discordance between social norms and economic conditions can be challenging to individuals' wellbeing. In this study, we use British cohort data and biomarker measures of stress consequences to address two research questions: How do men's and women's deviations from the male breadwinner norm (as evidenced by a non-traditional division of labor) relate to physiological stress at age 46? Does the association between a non-traditional division of labor and stress vary by gender attitudes? We analyze data from the 1970 British Cohort Study, a cohort study of all 17,000 Brits born in one week of 1970. The data allow us to assess the division of labour at ages 30, 34, and 42 by combining information on family formation (partnership and childbirth), employment, housework and earning patterns. Our outcome variable is allostatic load, measured at age 46. Allostatic load is a measure of physiological consequences to the experience of chronic stress. Preliminary results suggest that having a non-traditional division of labor that deviates from the male breadwinner norm may be associated with higher levels of chronic stress for men and women, but so are strongly gendered patterns. Sharing responsibility for income and housework appears to be most beneficial for both genders.","While female homemakers were once considered key contributors to the unpaid workforce, their current level of civic engagement (e.g., volunteering and informal caregiving) compared to that of working women remains uncertain. Previous research has largely focused on employed versus unemployed individuals or retirees, often grouping homemakers with other inactive individuals and overlooking homemaking as a distinct status that may shape civic engagement.\r\nThe absence of a work role could allow for greater civic engagement due to fewer time constraints, yet detachment from the labor market might reduce social integration, limiting engagement. These dynamics likely depend on children and their age, as school-aged children, for example, require less care and can enhance social integration through institutions like schools and sports clubs that encourage parental volunteering. Additionally, as societies have become more individualized and gender roles have modernized, both civic engagement patterns and the homemaker role have evolved.\r\nOur research asks: “How does the civic engagement of women differ when they are homemaking compared to when they are working, and what role do children and the historical context play?” Using data from the Swiss Household Panel (1999–2023) and fixed-effects regression models, we build on prior between-person studies. Preliminary findings indicate that homemakers are as likely to volunteer as working women but dedicate more hours and engage more in informal caregiving. We find no evidence that these relationships significantly vary based on the presence or age of children, nor when comparing two generations of women—those born before and after 1965.","Given the ongoing disparity in housework time between men and women, the question arises to what extent and under what circumstances parents transmit gendered household work patterns to their children. Applying theories of (gender role) socialization, we investigate the intergenerational transmission of time spent on housework. Specifically, we examine how fathers’ and mothers’ housework time influences that of their sons and daughters. Additionally, we investigate how these influences vary across key life course stages: children living in the parental home, living alone, living with a partner, and living with a partner and children. We hypothesize that the intergenerational transmission of housework time is stronger in same-sex parent-child dyads than in opposite-sex dyads, with the effect particularly strong in father-son dyads. Moreover, we predict that the resemblance between parents’ and children’s housework time is stronger the more similar children’s living situations are to those of their parents during their upbringing, that is, when they and their partners have children. We use data from the German Socioeconomic Panel (1984–2022), which includes annual self-reported information on time dedicated to housework for all household members. We analyze a sample of approximately 5,000 sons and daughters born between 1970 and 2002 who were raised in two-parent households until age 15. A preliminary analysis reveals various correlations between parents’ average housework time before their children turn 15 and the children’s own average housework time after the age of 15, depending on the sex of the parent and child. Regression models will further assess this association.","This study explores the residential transitions of young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering a novel perspective by integrating insights from both the 2008 financial crisis and the 2021 COVID-19 crisis. Using a life course perspective, we examine how historical timing, life events (e.g., leaving/returning home), and socioeconomic conditions (e.g., income, education, gender, and regional disparities) shape young adults’ housing trajectories. Our key research questions are: (1) How do economic crises influence young adults' residential independence? (2) What socio-economic and gendered dynamics drive leaving and returning home? Using Statbel register data (1993–2023), we apply logistic regression models to calculate the probability of leaving and returning home, controlling for selection bias with the Heckman Selection Model. This innovative approach provides new insights into how crises shape housing trajectories, showing delayed residential independence, with a narrowing gender gap in return rates. By uniquely combining past and present crises, our study delivers policy recommendations to enhance future pandemic preparedness, ensuring better support for vulnerable youth in housing and economic stability.","The aim of this study is to explore the academic performance of adolescents who are living with their single parents. Living with single parents is challenging experience especially when children are in adolescence phase. The core aim of study was to investigate how family environment, social status and parental support affect adolescents’ academic performance. This study is carried out in Punjab, Pakistan on adolescents who are experiencing the single family environment either my divorce or natural parental marital transition. Qualitative methodology was employed to evaluate the different aspects of aspects of academic performance. A sample of 40 students in-between age 14 to 18 years was selected from different institutions coming from different socio cultural backgrounds and having different family situations comprising different types of single family structure. Data was collected through semi structured interviews to explore the academics performance and family dynamics. Findings of the study indicated that adolescents living with single parents show poor academic performance due to lack of interest, absentees, poor social and economic support, less parental involvement. Students were showing less or no interest in extracurricular activities and less social interaction with fellows. Parental economic status , Parenting style, parental involvement and academic support are the key factors which directly academic outcomes. Research experience was challenging because students were reluctant to share family issues. Proper academic and counselling centre should be established to provide emotional and academic counselling for such students. Longitudinal research should be carried out to trace the academic outcomes and social adjustments.","The young adult life phase has changed substantially in recent years. Overall, young adulthood is increasingly characterized by uncertainty. This manifests in various ways: precarity at work, postponement of steps toward adulthood, and more unstable living situations and relationships. This paper maps the life-course of young people today. It does so by socioeconomic background. Although young people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may have the most difficulty to achieve the traditional steps to adulthood (e.g., leaving home), they are also expected to have the most intention to achieve these steps. As uncertainty might spill over from one domain to another, such as from the work to the housing domain, this paper takes a multi-domain approach shifting away from the focus in demographic literature on single transitions. Using Dutch register data for all young people in the Netherlands over the period 2011 to 2021, we employ Latent Class Analyses based on different aspects of the housing, family and work situation of young people. The results reveal a shift over time, as well as differences between individuals of lower and higher SES backgrounds.","In today’s world, family institution is facing turbulations and young people’s pathways towards adulthood are evolving through intergenerational exchanges that shape their prolonged navigation of responsibility. In this systematic review, I reflect on the phenomenon of prolonged transitions into adulthood, using intergenerational family support and the emergence of “Waithood” globally as a focus. Utilizing structured PRISMA guided analysis, I review the literature on waithood within a range of cultural contexts. I integrate perspectives from a life course theory approach, emerging adulthood, and varied culture-oriented notions of youth dependency. Analysis of this literature reveals an overall trend of prolonged transitional phases of becoming an adult experienced by youth universally, but the factors present in affluent societies versus resource-limited societies vary significantly. Families as a unit bear increasing economic responsibilities for adult children who cannot achieve traditional milestones of adulthood, which modifies the relationship of individual family members to each other, and impacts expectations of reciprocity. I also offer some critical reflections regarding gendered experiences in prolonged transitions that delineates important elements of distinct societal pressures and coping strategies among adolescents and young adult women and men. It is critical to note the agency youth demonstrate in responding to prolonged transitions as they employ innovative strategies of change in adulthood norms, formal entrepreneurship, and migration among other examples. However, despite extensive coverage, I found paucity of literature on comparative cross-cultural dynamics. Consequently, I identify gaps for future research, to emphasize comparative studies between Global North and South with different demographic and welfare state conditions.","Following the rise in unpartnered individuals, research is becoming increasingly attentive to the multi-faceted nature of how “being single” is perceived and experienced. A broad division is made between those considering their single status as their personal choice and those who would rather have a partner (Stein, 1978). Next, how singlehood is experienced has been found to vary by demographic factors, with e.g. women more likely to be satisfied with being single than men (Hoan & MacDonald, 2024; Yang & Chang, 2024), and middle-aged adults to be less satisfied than individuals of other age groups (Yu & Hara, 2023). These variations are important to recognise, as the way the single status is defined relates to satisfaction with the situation and, in turn, overall well-being. Given the worldwide rise in singlehood, understanding how the intersection between one’s self-definition of singlehood and demographic characteristics functions in light of singlehood satisfaction is becoming increasingly relevant. \r\nThis study builds upon existing research by examining in detail how individuals’ self-definition of singlehood relates to their satisfaction with being single, using the recently released 2024 singlehood module from the Gender and Generations Survey II (GGS). Chi-square tests assessed associations between key demographic characteristics (gender, age, and education level) and self-definition of singlehood, while Kruskal-Wallis tests examined how the intersections between demographics and self-definitions were associated with satisfaction with singlehood. \r\nBy focusing on variations within the single population, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how personal definitions of singlehood shape satisfaction, offering insights into the diversity of singlehood experiences. \r\n","As Dutch primary schools become increasingly diverse in terms of ethnicity, race, religion, gender, and sexuality, parents are confronted with new challenges in their parenting practices. Based on a study funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO), this research uses a multi-sited ethnographic design and compares two cases: a school in a gentrified Amsterdam neighbourhood with a 50/50 ethnic mix in terms of migration background, and a school in a medium-sized Dutch city with a similar composition but situated in a working-class context.\r\nThrough interviews with parents, teachers, and school leaders, the project explores how parenting strategies are shaped by social class, previous experiences with diversity, and the school’s and teachers’ approaches to diversity. The study critically engages with questions of colour-blind versus colour-conscious parenting, the emotional and practical labour involved in navigating diversity, and the often unspoken role white parents play in sustaining or challenging educational inequalities.\r\nIt contributes to broader debates on racial socialization, inclusion in education, and the sociology of parenting, while also raising questions about how diversity is experienced and negotiated in everyday school and family contexts.","Dutch Gymnasium schools have traditionally been known as predominantly white elite secondary schools (Merry and Boterman 2020). This article centres around students in Dutch Gymnasium schools who have a migration background and/or parents with -at most- a lower vocational education level . As their parents oftentimes didn’t attend an academic track in secondary school, these two groups of students are therefore “newcomers” to the Gymnasium school context. This newcomer position, together with the elitist image of the school and being a minority within a rather homogenous student body in terms of ethnic background (being without migration background) and education level of parents (being at the level of university of applied sciences and research university), raises the question how a sense of belonging in Gymnasium schools is experienced by “newcomer” students within these schools. It also begs the question how social boundaries in Gymnasium schools occur and how these schools can become more inclusive spaces, where “newcomers” aren’t just allowed to be present, but are also seen as equally belonging to that space, including their commonalities with and differences from the more “traditional” Gymnasium students.","\r\nIn this paper, we present stories of discrimination and disadvantage within Amsterdam’s education system, shared by parents and students of color and/or those with a migration background. These stories expose feelings and perspectives on discrimination and racism. Despite more than 40 years of policies aimed at addressing these issues, significant challenges remain. The stories highlight a wide range of concerns, including communication difficulties between schools and parents, conflicts within schools, low educational quality, and acts of discrimination. We will also reflect on the process of presenting these stories to a citizens' assembly, composed of 50 individuals representing migrant parents and parents of color in the city. This assembly developed bottom-up recommendations for school boards, the municipal government, and policymakers in education and other relevant fields in the city, aiming to combat racism and discrimination in education.","In our everyday encounters at higher education institutions in the Netherlands, we experience that diversity discomfort can severely hamper the creation of inclusive environments. Based on interdisciplinary critical literature, in this conceptual article we show that the unease that can arise from engaging with diverse people and perspectives often leads to the reproduction of power hierarchies. At the same time, we argue for the need to consider diversity discomfort as a catalyst for awareness and transformation. We draw upon literature focusing on power relations and learning theories, including concepts such as safe and brave space and pedagogy of discomfort. While doing so, we present some strategies and formulate a new research agenda on how to transform diversity discomfort from a barrier into a resource to create future-proof, meaningful, equitable higher education.","Research on sexual harassment (SH) prevalence in higher education has resulted in a wide range of prevalence rates (Bondestam and Lundqvist, 2020). In general, studies asking about self-labelled SH have led to much lower prevalence rates than studies presenting a specified list of sexually transgressive behaviours (STB) to their respondents. A common explanation for this prevalence gap is the inability of respondents to interpret their own sexually transgressive experience accurately because of false beliefs, such as rape myths and heteronormative sexual scripts (e.g. Hockett et al. 2017; Jenkins, 2017). However, not only in practice but also in research such limited understanding of SH prevails: Questionnaires including a predefined list of STB have initially been developed from a heteronormative, Global North, and gendered perspective on SH (Fitzgerald et al. 1988). Moreover, most research on SH prevalence has been conducted in Anglo-Saxon environments, with a focus on female students. Using a questionnaire including both SH prevalence measures within a Belgian university, the current study investigates whether this gap is more outspoken for those groups who do not match the ‘ideal victim’ profile and those SH experiences that are inconsistent to widespread false beliefs. Preliminary results show that certain sociodemographic, academic-related and incident-related characteristics influenced the likelihood for this prevalence gap to appear. If we want to strive towards inclusive policy and research in which all voices are heard, it is essential we consider these potential epistemic differences between university groups on what accounts for SH.","In this paper, we discuss epistemic inequality and marginalization within Belgian higher education. The paper adopts a decolonial perspective to examine knowledge production in academic positions within Belgian higher education spaces. Foregrounding the context of the university, in which anti-colonial knowledge is simultaneously marginalised, the article asks what the possibilities are for decolonial critiques of knowledge within universities. In particular, we consider what it means to conduct decolonial research as an academic in the context of the Belgian university. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with racialized PhD researchers, this paper finds that the university remains a site where epistemic exclusionary practices are reproduced.  Findings show that dominant social science conceptions of scientific validity and neutrality often reproduce the epistemic status quo. The paper exposes how hegemonic conceptions contribute to perpetuating ‘epistemic coloniality,’ marginalizing research that uses a decolonial approach and denying such research validity. The analyses revealed four key findings. First, conducting decolonial research remains a challenging endeavor. Second, racialized researchers' racial backgrounds are often viewed as a weakness, leading to perceptions of 'subjectivity' when studying communities they belong to. Third, participants reported being discouraged and warned against engaging in decolonial content. Finally, critical scholarship on race is frequently dismissed as inherently political, relegating it to a marginalized position within academia. This paper outlines some key tensions and challenges faced by racialized decolonial scholars at both theoretical and methodological levels and overall underscores the need for recognition and effort to embrace critical epistemologies within higher education in Belgium.","Het welzijn van studenten in het hoger onderwijs staat vaak ter discussie, met name in de nasleep van de Covid-19-pandemie (Versteeg & Kappe, 2021). Daarnaast spelen structurele factoren zoals prestatiedruk en sociale ongelijkheid een belangrijke rol. Studies tonen aan dat prestatiedruk, versterkt door beleidsmaatregelen zoals de bindend studieadviesnorm en sociale vergelijkingen via sociale media, een negatieve invloed kan hebben op het welzijn (Frison & Eggermont, 2016; Klinkenberg, Versteeg & Kappe, 2023; Van der Meer, Jansen & Torenbeek, 2010). Bovendien blijft ongelijkheid in het onderwijs een punt van zorg: studenten met meer sociaal en economisch kapitaal lijken beter te presteren dan hun peers (Kennisrotonde, 2023). Onze analyse bouwt voort op Bourdieu’s concept van sociaal kapitaal (1986), waarbij we onderzoeken hoe studenten met verschillende sociaaleconomische achtergronden verschillen in herstel na COVID-19.\r\nOm deze trends beter te begrijpen, analyseren we data uit de Studentenwelzijnsmonitor (SWM) van Hogeschool Inholland, een longitudinaal survey-onderzoek naar studentenwelzijn. Tussen 2021 en 2024 zijn kernindicatoren zoals depressieve symptomen, veerkracht, prestatiedruk en de invloed van achtergrondkenmerken onderzocht. De eerste resultaten laten significante verbeteringen zien in depressieve symptomen, emotionele uitputting en studiestress. Echter, positieve constructen zoals studiemotivatie en veerkracht tonen minder consistente trends. De invloed van het cohortjaar op welzijnsuitkomsten bleek beperkt, terwijl factoren zoals geslacht, leeftijd en studiejaar een sterkere rol speelden.\r\nTijdens de presentatie bespreken we deze kwantitatieve resultaten in combinatie met verdiepend kwalitatief onderzoek naar prestatiedruk en de ervaringen van eerste-generatiestudenten, dat momenteel wordt uitgevoerd. Ook worden de bevindingen van de SWM uit mei 2025 meegenomen.\r\n•\tBourdieu, P. (1986). The forms of capital. In J.

As such, there is a compelling empirical question to be asked: are religious schools effective in accomplishing one of the main goals of education—to equip students with knowledge and skills to participate effectively in the labor market? Many earlier studies have investigated the relationship between religious schooling and academic achievement and suggested that religious schools may facilitate the accumulation of social capital that subsequently improves achievement. However, only a few studies (from the field of economics) focused on the relationship between religious schooling and labor market outcomes. These studies focused almost exclusively on Catholic schools and were conducted in countries where religious schools are private or where they charge fees and set admission criteria. Due to this, it is difficult to distinguish the effect of religious schooling from the effect of private schooling. In this paper, we contribute to the literature by studying a wide range of school denominations (Catholic, Protestant, Islamic, and Hindu schools) and use administrative data from the Netherlands. This data better allows us to study the effect of religious schooling because all schools in the Netherlands have been funded equally since 1917 and are free of charge, irrespective of their ideological affiliation.","Research has shown that there is inequality in teachers’ expectations. Teachers, for example, on average expect less from lower-SES students, even if their performance levels are equal to those of higher-SES students. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Scholars posit that it might partly be rooted in the way teachers evaluate their students: studies show that teachers differ in the extent to which they on average consider certain student characteristics when formulating expectations. Research suggests that teachers also differ in the extent to which they use the same standards for all their students. While some teachers use the same standardized data sources and predefined criteria for all students, others rely on different sources and criteria across students. Studies emphasize the importance of using the same standards for all to reduce negative bias. However, adjusting evaluation practices to individual students might come with positive bias for disadvantaged students, which might be necessary to mitigate inequality. Thus, it remains a puzzle how the extent to which teachers rely on the same standardized performance measures when forming expectations for different students, relates to biases in teachers’ expectations for students based on SES and migration background. Using data from the COOL5-18 cohort study, we show that some teachers show a negative, while others show a positive bias against lower-SES students and students with a migration background. Moreover, teachers differ substantially in their reliance on the same standardized measures for all students. We will investigate how this relates to bias in teachers’ expectations using multilevel SEM.","BACKGROUND Grade retention, or repeating an academic year, is still widely used across countries to address classroom heterogeneity, despite limited evidence regarding its effectiveness. While often framed as a support for struggling students, grade retention may in fact reinforce existing disadvantages, perpetuating educational inequality. Most research on predictors has focused on the student-level, overlooking broader structural contexts influencing grade retention decisions in schools and educational systems. AIMS This study builds on the Dynamic Model of Educational Effectiveness to investigate Q1) which school-level characteristics are associated with grade retention in lower-secondary education across European countries, Q2) how these associations differ between countries; and Q3) which educational-system-level characteristics might explain between-country differences. METHODS Utilizing PISA 2018 data, we conducted multilevel regression analysis to assess fixed (Q1) and random school estimates (Q2), and plan to test interaction effects between school- and system-level variables (Q3). RESULTS Analyzing data from 123,511 students in 5,693 schools across 24 countries, we identified several school characteristics linked to grade retention, grouped into two domains: organizational structure and data use (e.g., ability grouping, selective admission), and school population and resources (e.g., student-body composition and facilities). Importantly, the strength and direction of these associations varied considerably across countries DISCUSSION This paper highlights the importance of school characteristics and educational systems for understanding grade retention from a holistic perspective.  The findings underscore the need for systemic reform to address the institutional conditions that contribute to grade retention, offering valuable insights for policymakers aiming to promote equitable education systems.","This paper explores the intersection of competitiveness and socioeconomic status (SES) in shaping student outcomes across educational systems. Competitiveness, defined as a “dispositional desire to outperform others,” is deeply embedded in education through practices such as standardized testing, grading on a curve, and public comparisons. While it can motivate students, competitiveness may also exacerbate SES-related achievement gaps—an area largely overlooked in current research.\r\nThe study examines how competitiveness interacts with SES, noting that competitive environments may amplify disadvantages for lower SES students who lack the preparatory resources of their higher SES peers. Psychological models, such as the social class mismatch theory, suggest that schools reflect middle- and upper-class norms, creating barriers for lower SES students. Sociologically, competitiveness is often encouraged by middle- and upper-class parents through achievement-oriented activities, whereas lower SES students may view competition as unfair.\r\nTwo main contributions are highlighted: first, the study differentiates between “experienced” competitiveness (individual perceptions) and “school-level” competitiveness (institutional norms), offering a more nuanced understanding of how competition operates within education. Second, it investigates how educational tracking—sorting students by ability—relates to competitive climates and SES disparities. While tracking is known to reinforce inequality, its role in fostering competitiveness has been underexplored.\r\nUsing data from PISA 2018 and hierarchical linear modeling (N = 365,161), the study addresses two questions: (1) How does SES moderate the impact of competitiveness on academic outcomes and self-perception? and (2) How does educational tracking influence competitiveness? These findings aim to refine theory and inform educational policy on mitigating SES-related inequalities.","Onderwijs heeft twee kerntaken: bevorderen van prestaties en bestrijden van sociale ongelijkheid. Beide doelen worden vaak incompatibel geacht, waarbij slechts één van de twee optimaal nagestreefd kan worden. Tegenwoordig kent Westers onderwijs een hyperfixatie op prestatie, wat de onderwijsorganisatie beïnvloedt. Van gedifferentieerde onderwijssystemen wordt verwacht dat ze de nationale onderwijsprestatie optimaliseren maar die staan tegelijk gekend om hun sterkere reproductie van sociale ongelijkheid. Die spreidstand tussen prestatie en sociale rechtvaardigheid hoeft niet te bestaan. Scandinavische landen met een comprehensief onderwijssysteem kunnen uitstekende PISA-resultaten voorleggen zonder op sociale gelijkheid in te boeten. Toch blijft de angst bestaan dat comprehensief secundair onderwijs prestaties ondermijnt, voornamelijk doordat sterke leerlingen onvoldoende uitgedaagd worden. Voor dat argument is weinig empirisch bewijs. Onderzoek toont juist aan dat sterke leerlingen minder gevoelig zijn voor invloeden uit hun leeromgeving, zoals klasgenoten en verwachtingen van leerkrachten. Om de impact van comprehensief onderwijs op sterke leerlingen te vatten werd een mixed-methods onderzoek uitgevoerd aan de hand van een multilevel-analyse van PISA 2018-data uit 25 landen en een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse van twee, in 2024 afgenomen focusgroepen met elf participanten in een Vlaamse secundaire school met uitgestelde studiekeuze. De resultaten tonen aan dat de prestatie van sterke leerlingen niet significant afneemt in comprehensief onderwijs doordat peer effects hun prestatie minder sterk beïnvloeden en lerarencultuur geen significante invloed heeft. De resultaten van de focusgroepen liggen in lijn met die redenering. Sterke leerlingen blijven daar sterk presteren door de ondersteuning vanuit hun sociale omgeving en door de gemeenschappelijke en individuele strategieën die ze ontwikkelen.","Schoolboeken spelen niet enkel een belangrijke rol in het onderwijzen van kinderen maar ze dragen ook bij aan de sociale en culturele beeld-vorming van leerlingen. Binnen de brede waaier aan kennisbronnen over de sociale wereld (familie, televisie, boeken, vrienden, sociale media, enz.) nemen schoolboeken net door hun pedagogische claim naar ‘objectiviteit’  dan ook een geprivilegieerde positie in. Dit maakt het des te opmerkelijker dat de wijze waarop sociale identiteit wordt weergegeven in Vlaamse schoolboeken tot op heden nog weinig of niet werd onderzocht. Deze studie onderzoekt voor het eerst in Vlaanderen hoe gender, etnische diversiteit, sociaaleconomische status, lichaamsvorm en fysieke beperking worden voorgesteld in schoolboeken voor het basisonderwijs. Hiervoor analyseren we afbeeldingen in meer dan 150 boeken van de vijf grootste uitgeverijen van schoolboeken in Vlaanderen. We kijken niet alleen naar de frequentie waarmee bepaalde personages worden afgebeeld en hoe dit overeenkomt met de Vlaamse bevolking, maar ook naar de manier waarop ze worden gepresenteerd. Worden vrouwen bijvoorbeeld vaker afgebeeld terwijl ze huishoudelijke taken uitvoeren dan mannen? Worden personages met een donkere huidskleur vaker in een passieve rol weergegeven? En nemen personages met een fysieke beperking actief deel aan sociale interacties en activiteiten? Daarnaast analyseren we hoe deze boeken thema’s als pesten en discriminatie behandelen. Dit onderzoek combineert een kwantitatieve en kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse van schoolboeken Nederlands, Wiskunde en Wereldoriëntatie uit het 1e (groep 3), 3e (groep 5) en 6e leerjaar (groep 8) van het lager onderwijs.","In this paper, we examine how access to Surinamese education has developed over approximately 40 years, as evidenced by a cohort comparison of individuals born between 1945 and 1990, who were in education between approximately 1960 and 2010. As in other countries, Suriname has experienced a continuous increase in education levels. Like in other countries, this educational expansion has been more pronounced for women than for men. In the most recent cohort, women, on average, have achieved an education level equivalent to that of men. Regarding ethnic groups, there has been significant convergence in educational outcomes: the groups at the bottom of the hierarchy have caught up with those at the top. However, Maroons and Indigenous people still lag behind other ethnic groups in the most recent cohort. The most remarkable development has been among Javanese women, who have experienced the strongest growth of all the groups studied.\r\nNext, we explore how socio-economic backgrounds (measured by education and occupations of both parents) influence access to education. In Suriname, inequality in educational outcomes based on socio-economic status (SES) is also significant. At first glance, the differences in influence between parents with lower and higher status seem to decrease in younger cohorts, but this trend almost disappears when we take into account the convergence in educational outcomes between ethnic groups. A possible explanation for the persistence of unequal educational opportunities based on socio-economic background is that in Suriname's education system, the least educated and the most educated still remain very far apart.\r\n","De arbeidsmarktparticipatie van statushouders in met name Noord Nederland blijft achter. Eén oorzaak hiervan is dat werkgevers contracten vaak niet verlengen vanwege een gebrekkige ‘person-job’ en/of ‘person-organization fit'. We presenteren ons door ZonMw gefinancierde co-creatie project, met als focus gemeentelijke professionals die de cruciale schakel vormen in het ‘matchen’ van statushouders en werkgevers. We laten zien hoe we samen met werkgevers, gemeenten en statushouders in de arbeidsmarktregio Groningen en Noord-Drenthe werken aan de duurzame en passende arbeidsmarktparticipatie van statushouders door het faciliteren van een goede ‘match’ tussen statushouder en werkgever. Dit doen wij via de gezamenlijke ontwikkeling van twee evidence-and theory-based interventies voor gemeentelijke professionals: een training en toolbox. We gaan met name in op de vertaling van theoretische inzichten (person-organization fit en job-organization fit) naar een digitale toolbox met daarin concrete handvatten die gemeentelijke arbeidsbemiddelaars kunnen inzetten om werkgevers\r\n· te informeren over het aannemen van statushouders\r\n· te faciliteren bij maken van een goede ‘fit’ \r\n· voor te bereiden op een startende statushouder in hun organisatie.\r\n","In januari 2022 trad de nieuwe Wet inburgering in werking, als reactie op tekortkomingen uit de vorige wet. Binnen deze nieuwe wet kregen gemeenten opnieuw de verantwoordelijkheid voor het aanbod en de monitoring van de inburgeringstrajecten. Ook zijn er voortaan drie mogelijke ‘routes’ naar inburgering, om beter aan te sluiten bij de capaciteiten en behoeften van nieuwkomers.  \r\nDe wet is ingestoken als ‘lerend en adaptief’. Dit betekent dat de opzet en uitvoering veranderd kan worden als daar aanleiding toe is. Tegen die achtergrond doen we in Rotterdam vier jaar lang (2022-2026) onderzoek naar de opzet, uitvoering en resultaten van het nieuwe inburgeringsbeleid.  \r\nAfgelopen onderzoeksperiode (2023-2024) deden we aan de hand van interviews, observaties en focusgroepen uitgebreid onderzoek onder inburgeraars en professionals. De verzamelde data toont het aanpassingsvermogen en de betrokkenheid van uitvoerders in Rotterdam. We zien dat maatwerk steeds meer mogelijk is maar in de praktijk ook grenzen blijft kennen. Hetzelfde geldt voor de Vroege Start. De combinatie van taal leren en participatie blijft voor alle betrokken een grote uitdaging. Daarnaast loopt men tegen praktische knelpunten aan, zoals het gebrek aan kinderopvang, spreekkamers en (gekwalificeerde) docenten. De wet, en daarmee de mogelijkheden van de gemeente, zijn bovendien een stuk beperkter voor gezinsmigranten.  \r\nDeze bevindingen vragen aandacht van de nationale en lokale overheden, maar bieden ook aanknopingspunten voor het bestuderen en verbeteren van (inburgerings-)beleid in andere gemeenten.","Spreidingsbeleid dat statushouders proportioneel verdeelt over verschillende regio's binnen een land, blijkt te leiden tot ongelijkheid in de arbeidsmarktkansen van vluchtelingen. Statushouders die – buiten hun eigen schuld – worden geplaatst in regio's met hogere werkloosheidspercentages, hebben minder kans om werk te vinden. Omdat de meeste onderzoeken deze ongelijkheid op één moment in de tijd bestuderen, weten we nog maar weinig over hoe deze ongelijkheid zich in de loop der tijd ontwikkelt. Er bestaan concurrerende theorieën over hoe deze ongelijkheid zich in de tijd zou kunnen ontwikkelen. Theorieën over cumulative advantage suggereren dat ongelijkheid in de loop der tijd zal toenemen terwijl meritocratie-theorieën juist suggereren dat ongelijkheid na verloop van tijd zal afnemen. We gebruiken longitudinale survey- en registergegevens van een grote en representatieve groep Syrische statushouders in Nederland om dit te onderzoeken. De quasi-willekeurige plaatsing van statushouders in Nederland vormt een natuurlijk experiment om causale effecten vast te stellen. Dit gecombineerd met de rijke longitudinale gegevens, stelt ons in staat om de lange-termijn causale effecten van de plaatsingsregio van statushouders op hun arbeidsparticipatie te onderzoeken. De resultaten laten zien dat de plaatsingsregio aanvankelijk weinig invloed heeft, maar dat deze na verloop van tijd toeneemt en een piek bereikt circa drie jaar na huisvesting, waarna de invloed weer geleidelijk afneemt. Al met al vinden we een negatieve invloed van plaatsing in een regio met hogere werkloosheidspercentages gedurende bijna de gehele observatieperiode van zeven jaar. Dit suggereert dat er lange-termijn ongelijkheid bestaat onder statushouders gebaseerd op hun quasi-willekeurig toegewezen plaatsingsregio.","In Nederland zijn statushouders verplicht om een inburgeringstraject te volgen. Het leren van de Nederlandse taal staat hier centraal. Voor veel statushouders is het leren van het Nederlands meer dan alleen een vereiste: het is de sleutel tot sociale en economische zelfredzaamheid, persoonlijke vrijheid en een gevoel van erbij horen. Onderzoek onder vluchtelingen laat echter een verontrustende trend zien: hoewel velen in de beginperiode aanzienlijke verbeteringen doormaken, stagneert na afronding van de inburgering – meestal na drie jaar – de verbeteringen in de Nederlandse taalbeheersing. Hierdoor blijft het taalniveau achter, hetgeen participatie op de arbeidsmarkt belemmert. Dit roept vragen op over hoe vluchtelingen het beste kunnen worden ondersteund bij hun taalverwerving. Deze studie gebruikt drie waves van enquêtegegevens (2017, 2019, 2022) om de factoren te onderzoeken die de verwerving van de Nederlandse taal beïnvloeden onder Syrische Nederlanders die als vluchteling naar Nederland kwamen. We streven ernaar een genuanceerder perspectief te bieden op de factoren die de paden van vluchtelingen naar zelfredzaamheid vormgeven, door de structurele factoren van inburgerings- en vestigingsbeleid te onderzoeken naast individuele kenmerken. Ons gesegmenteerde mixed-effects model legt zowel kortetermijn- als langetermijndynamiek vast, en biedt inzicht in de complexe dynamiek van taalverwerving in de loop van de tijd. Dit onderzoek stelt het idee van een lineair taalontwikkelingsproces ter discussie, terwijl het kritisch ingaat op de structurele factoren, waaronder het inburgeringsbeleid, die de taalontwikkeling van vluchtelingen beïnvloeden.  \r\n\r\n","Statushouders hebben een aanzienlijk lagere arbeidsparticipatie en zijn vaker langdurig afhankelijk van de bijstand dan andere bevolkingsgroepen. Dit verhoogt het risico op sociale uitsluiting, verlaagt hun eigenwaarde en draagt bij aan de depreciatie van hun menselijk kapitaal. Hoewel er veel onderzoek is gedaan naar bijstandsafhankelijkheid onder statushouders, ligt de nadruk in bestaand onderzoek veelal op verklaringen op het niveau van individuen of huishoudens. Hierdoor blijft de rol van het op vluchtelingen gericht beleid  op de uitstroom onderbelicht, terwijl statushouders juist aan het begin van hun verblijf in Nederland geconfronteerd worden met dit beleid.  \r\nIn dit onderzoek analyseren we hoe het opvang- en inburgeringsbeleid de duur van bijstandsafhankelijkheid beïnvloeden. We richten ons daarbij specifiek op uitstroom naar werk. Ons onderzoek belicht de invloed van verhuizingen tussen opvanglocaties, verblijfsduur in opvanglocaties, het afronden van de inburgering en het inburgeringsniveau op de kans om de transitie van bijstand naar werk te maken. We onderzoeken ook of en in hoeverre de effecten van deze beleidsfactoren veranderen naarmate de tijd die verstrijkt sinds hun huisvesting, en of de effecten verschillen tussen mannen en vrouwen. \r\nWe analyseren CBS-registerdata van ongeveer 100.000 statushouders die tussen 2014 en 2022 een verblijfsvergunning ontvingen. Voor deze studie maken we gebruik van discrete-tijd-duuranalyse geschat met van multilevel lineaire waarschijnlijkheidsmodellen.","Translation of science to a general public is increasingly important in modern academia. Yet, there is little knowledge on whether and why scientists do so. Here, we provide an account of a population of German social science professors (N = 2,207). We ask whether and to what extent scientists appear in German printed media (N = 26,729) as a result of cumulative advantage, reputation, and gender. We uniquely link bibliometric data on professors’ careers and data on their appearances in printed media through unique, principled crosswalks of different databases using natural language processing. Departing from the literature on inequality in science, we develop hypotheses on how reputation, cumulative advantage, and gender relate to professors’ media appearances. Employing a series of longitudinal logistic and linear regression analyses we find support for the majority of our conjectures. Professors’ reputation and, in particular, cumulative advantages positively relate to newspaper appearances. Once a scientist has been mentioned in the media they seem “short-listed”. Men have a higher frequency of newspaper appearances than women, which seems driven by men more likely to be top mediagenic professors. Finally, the associations between reputation, cumulative advantage, and the number of media appearances are stronger for men than for women. We discuss the implications of these results for media practice and science evaluation.","Economic hardship is a well-established determinant of stress and adverse health outcomes. However, its relationship with loneliness—an issue of growing concern at both individual and societal levels—remains insufficiently understood. This study systematically reviews and synthesizes previous research, with a particular focus on factors that either exacerbate or mitigate the impact of economic hardship on loneliness.  \r\nFollowing a comprehensive screening process, 280 predominantly quantitative studies were included in the review. The majority of these studies report a significant association between economic hardship and loneliness, though the strength of this relationship varies considerably. Several contextual and structural factors contribute to this variation.  \r\nSocial integration emerges as a key moderating factor, as individuals who maintain connections within work, household, neighborhood, and voluntary associations are less vulnerable to the adverse effects of economic hardship. Conversely, social comparisons within one's network play a crucial role; individuals who perceive a substantial financial disparity between themselves and their peers are more likely to experience loneliness. Additionally, governmental support mechanisms—particularly policies aimed at alleviating financial distress—may buffer the effects of economic hardship, although this area remains underexplored.  \r\nThis study advances the literature by proposing a model that situates coping processes within a broader social framework, recognizing that coping mechanisms operate not only at the individual level but also within meso- and macro-level structures. Future research should employ this model to examine coping as a socially embedded process, extending beyond individual adaptation to incorporate structural and contextual influences.  \r\n","Proficiency of the Dutch language plays a pivotal role at the start of the school career of children. Children who are not exposed to the Dutch language at home start their primary education with a disadvantage, which may negatively affect their school performance. It is of great societal importance to gain insight into the factors influencing language proficiency of second generation children of whom both parents were not born in the Netherlands. Using the whole population network database from Statistics Netherlands, this paper investigates to what extent isolation – the exposure of a child to their own origin group in the network – influences their Dutch language proficiency. In addition, the importance of isolation in different layers of the network as well as exposure through direct and indirect contacts is investigated. Results show that for children whose parents are both born abroad a higher share of people from the own origin group in the network is related to a lower score on the language section of the final-year primary school exam. Both direct and indirect contacts of the classmate and family layer of the network play a major role in exposure, in addition to direct contacts of the neighbour network and the indirect contacts of the household member network. This research concludes that exposure - or a lack of exposure – to the Dutch language through various parts of the personal network affects language proficiency of primary school students.","Decades of sociological research have extensively examined the determinants of socioeconomic outcomes, emphasizing the role of luck, genetics, and social contexts such as families, schools, or neighborhoods. However, determining their importance is challenging because individuals are embedded in complex networks of these social contexts, which interact with each other and with individual characteristics to constrain or facilitate opportunities.\r\nHere, we assess how administrative data from the CBS on the social contexts of children at age 12 (before tracking into secondary schools) is able to predict educational attainment at age 25. To model the myriad interactions between networks of social contexts and individual characteristics, we use statistical models of increasing complexity, from linear models to graph neural networks---an innovative model that directly uses the entire network of social contexts.\r\nWe find that educational attainment at age 12 is well predicted by variables from nuclear families, while extended families, schools, and neighborhoods play relatively minor roles in aggregated. Importantly, our approach uncovers a large heterogeneity in the interactions between different social contexts, and examining these interactions through the lens of sociological theory will either support certain theories or prompt us to revise them to explain the contradictory findings.","Community Energy Initiatives (CEIs) are crucial for an inclusive energy transition, yet many fail to attract sufficient participants and are biased toward citizens with higher socioeconomic status. This pitfall stems from policies focusing predominantly on individual psychological traits, neglecting social network and community-level characteristics. To overcome this gap, we use network and survey data from a Dutch village and combine common survey methods with social network analysis (SNA) to design targeted intervention strategies.\r\nTo do so, we investigate the local network structure and the embededness of the CEI at hand. Further, we calibrated threshold models of diffusion with the case data to test different intervention/seeding strategies. Participation in CEIs was modeled as a social behavior based not only on individual characteristics, but also on social susceptibility (SS) of the behavior at hand. This yields diffusion models that simulated the adoption of CEI participation throughout the local network over time.\r\nThree intervention strategies were tested: random seeding, central-node seeding, and subcluster-central seeding under three scenarios of increasing SS. Simulations revealed that random seeding, though commonly employed, yields unpredictable outcomes under high SS. In contrast, strategies targeting central nodes or subcluster cores achieved better diffusion and reduced uncertainty regardless of SS scenarios.\r\nFindings were implemented by CEI initiators and have broader implications for collective action and diffusion of innovation in the context of the energy transition. Further, our approach raises questions about threshold scenario realism and cross-case intervention efficacy, laying the groundwork for future research on social influence and calibrated simulations.\r\n","The Dutch climate movement is one of the most successful national climate movements worldwide. However, it features a unique structure: its largest social movement organization (SMO), Extinction Rebellion (XR), is also its most radical one, coexisting with other NGOs and grassroots groups. Based on interviews with 29 activists, in this article we investigate the activists’ perception of the intergroup dynamics in the movement, particularly in light of the of differences in their SMOs’ radicalness. We identify three themes. Firstly, the activists positioned XR as central to the Dutch movement, hailing its disruptive tactics as key to the movement’s success and its radicalness as useful in legitimising other SMOs and the movement. Secondly, however, XR’s impact was only perceived as possible by the complementarity present in the movement. The SMOs’ differences created different entry points for newcomers, and enabled complementarity when fighting common targets and in collaborating. Finally, activists balanced the immediate success of their own SMO versus that of the broader movement. At times, they chose to prioritise the movement at the expense of their own SMO’s immediate gains, while at others, they saw strengthening their SMO as crucial for the movement’s long-term success. By detailing activists’ perceptions of the movement’s intergroup dynamics, this article theoretically contributes to the radical flank effect, illuminating the dynamics of a case where, rather than a fringe group, the radical flank is the movement’s central force. These novel insights can have practical implications for activists organising in other multi-SMO movements.","Urban green spaces (UGS) are gaining attention for their positive effects on climate adaptation, biodiversity and (mental) health: they benefit air quality, temperatures, stimulate physical movement, reduce stress and contribute to public familiarity and social cohesion. \r\nAt the same time, concerns rise about UGS in relation to inequality and injustice. Predominantly focussing on the unequal distribution of, and access to UGS, public authorities tend to see the introduction of UGS mostly as an implementation challenge. However, scholars also address procedural and recognitive justice related to the involvement of local communities and the acknowledgement and representation of diverse needs and wishes, as the perspectives of residents of targeted neighbourhoods are often overlooked. \r\nThis qualitative research, using in-depth interviews, therefore focusses on the meanings inhabitants of South-Rotterdam attribute to urban green(ing), and their (non-)participation in greening initiatives. This study reveals the diversity and complexity of the sense-making residents develop to urban nature and the importance of adjusting UGS and greening efforts to local lived environments. Gaining empirically grounded insights into how citizens make sense of inclusive UGS and greening initiatives is crucial in the context of a municipality focusing on participatory UGS against a background of high levels of poverty, stigmatization, and distrust in institutions.","Onderzoek naar duurzame consumptie toonde herhaaldelijk een ‘attitude-behaviour paradox’ (ABP): mensen vinden duurzaamheid belangrijk, maar vertalen dit niet consequent in duurzaam gedrag. Tegen die achtergrond onderzoekt dit artikel verantwoordingsstrategieën rond consumptiekeuzes bij leden van de middenklasse. \r\nEen thematische analyse van 20 diepte-interviews rond kleding, huisvesting, transport en voeding onthult drie verantwoordingsstrategieën. Ten eerste beroepen respondenten zich op een gevoel van ‘entitlement’ bij niet-duurzame praktijken door deze te framen als essentieel voor hun ‘zelfontplooiing’ en ‘zelfexpressie’. Ten tweede hanteren zij een ‘conscious-awareness’-logica waar men duidelijk ‘grenzen’ stelt aan duurzaamheidsinspanningen om het haalbaar te houden. De ‘bewuste’ keuze laat hen toe niet-duurzame keuzes als verantwoord te zien. Beide strategieën tonen dat een ecologische houding niet altijd samenvalt met de bereidheid comfort en verlangens op te geven. Dit leidt naar een derde strategie: compensatie. Omdat (1) respondenten niet bereid zijn bepaalde gedragingen op te geven, (2) ze over de middelen beschikken om aanpassingen te doen, en (3) duurzaamheid inherent multidimensionaal is, compenseren ze niet-duurzame keuzes door op andere vlakken wél duurzaam te handelen. Sommige consumptiepatronen zijn zo fundamenteel voor de ‘voracious’ middenklasse dat ze niet ter discussie staan, zelfs niet in naam van duurzaamheid. Dit uit zich vooral binnen het domein ‘transport’, en met name reizen.\r\nTheoretisch suggereert dit dat de ABP mogelijk niet bestaat voor deze respondenten. Onze bevindingen tonen bovendien aan dat de respondenten op een zeer ‘klassengebonden’ wijze omgaan met duurzaamheid waarbij beschikbare middelen en typische middenklasse waarden een cruciale rol spelen.","Notwithstanding the generally disadvantaged position of women in the labour market in the past, there have always been some women who were exceptionally successful. Because they were a small minority – most women who worked did so in low status occupations – they hardly appear in representative datasets and therefore have been rarely studied. In this paper we combine biographical data on successful Dutch women born in the 19th century with a representative sample of working women from the same period. We ask the question: what made that some women attained much higher occupational status than the average woman?\r\nThe biographical data are from the Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland, from which we select women born in the Netherlands between 1849 and 1922. The population data are from the Historical Sample of the Netherlands which contains life course data from a series of administrative records for a similar period. Analyses show that not only father’s occupational status was an important predictor for women’s success in the labor market, but also mother’s status and partner’s status. Women who didn’t marry and didn’t have children, were more likely to reach a high status as well. High-status women seem to be less affected by parental resources than low-status women.\r\n","Inequality of educational opportunity and its trend over time is one of the most prominent policy concerns in Western countries. Inequality of educational opportunity can be defined as a situation where children with similar innate capabilities have different educational outcomes as a result of their different (socio-economic) circumstances, which contributes to social stratification. Intergenerational transmission of education is often used as an indicator of inequality of opportunity. However, shared genes are a major source of resemblance between parents and children, and studies on intergenerational transmission are unable to distinguish between genetic effects and influence of the family environment. Twin studies are designed to parse out the effects of genes versus the shared environment by making use of the difference in genetic relatedness of monozygotic versus dizygotic twins. The current study uses population-wide data on twins and siblings of Dutch origin, birth cohorts 1964-1997, from integral registers of Statistics Netherlands. We assess trends in genetic influence (‘heritability’) and the influence of the shared environment on educational attainment in the Netherlands. We adapt the classical twin design to estimate heritability in the absence of information on zygosity. Over these thirty-four years heritability of educational attainment increased and the influence of the shared environment decreased. Hence, educational attainment has become increasingly determined by innate capabilities, which strongly suggests a decrease in inequality of opportunity in these birth cohorts of Dutch origin. This study contributes to insight in contemporary patterns of stratification. Future research should focus on younger cohorts and non-Dutch origin groups.","Cultural capital comprises a declarative (conscious) and a non-declarative (unconscious) aspect, with the latter considered crucial in everyday health-related choices. Yet, extant quantitative research into the relationship between cultural capital and health-related outcomes has only been able to investigate the declarative aspect of cultural capital. The current study aims to overcome this limitation by implementing a novel methodology to measure non-declarative cultural capital empirically and exploring to what extent it 1) associates with nutritional practices and 2) mediates the relationship between (parental) socioeconomic position and these practices.\r\nThe study draws upon a recently developed analytical tool using two Implicit Association Tests (IATs): one IAT measuring the appreciation of elite over common cultural expressions, and one IAT measuring self-identification with elite over common cultural expressions. These were embedded in a survey fielded among members of a high-quality panel drawn randomly from the official Dutch population register (n = 2,436), which also includes a short food frequency questionnaire.\r\nWe find that both declarative and non-declarative cultural capital are independently associated with adherence to dietary guidelines, and partly contribute to the relationship between educational attainment and adherence to dietary guidelines. This provides the first empirical validation of the widely assumed relationship between non-declarative cultural and food-related practices, while also highlighting that both declarative and non-declarative cultural capital are relevant for understanding (socially stratified patterns in) food-related practices."]},"columns":[{"id":".details","name":"","type":null,"sortable":false,"resizable":false,"filterable":false,"searchable":false,"width":45,"align":"center","details":["Samenvatting: Street harassment is a persistent societal challenge, leading to feelings of unsafety in public spaces and long-lasting consequences for targets, ultimately reinforcing gender inequality. Despite global efforts to prevent street harassment, little attention has been given to the role of youth professionals—those working daily with youth at the neighbourhood or street level—in addressing this issue. Youth professionals build long-term relationships with youth, promoting youth’s self-confidence, sense of belonging and pro-social behaviour, making them uniquely positioned to contribute to the prevention of street harassment.\r\nThis study explores how youth professionals in Rotterdam (opbouwend en grensstellend jongerenwerk) engage with youth (aged 12-24) who (may) participate in street harassment. By applying an inductive data analysis on semi-structured interviews with n=28 youth professionals, it aims to understand how youth professionals make sense of youths’ involvement in street harassment, and how this shapes the way they address such behaviour. \r\nPreliminary findings indicate that youth professionals perceive street harassment behaviour as part of young people’s sexual development and boundary exploration. Although they most notably cite peer pressure and social-media shaped social norms as key drivers of this behaviour, their strategies to address it primarily focus on fostering perspective-taking and empathy in one-on-one interactions. Yet, they acknowledge the limits of this approach, as peer pressure – reinforced by group dynamics – often overrides individual perspectives and intentions. Our findings suggest that it is essential to equip youth professionals with easy-to-use tools for preventing street harassment applicable in a group setting, building on existing group dynamics.","Samenvatting: Gebaseerd op etnografisch onderzoek presenteren we drie manieren waarop jongeren hun geweld van betekenis voorzien. Ten eerste zeggen zij dat overweldigd raken door blinde woede en niet meer voor rede vatbaar zijn. Jongeren zeggen echter ook dat zij sterke gevoelens van angst, spanning en boosheid proberen te verbergen of te veranderen door hun houding en manier van bewegen aan te passen en dat ze de emoties van de ander proberen te lezen. In dit tweede patroon koppelen ze de beheersing van emoties aan effectief geweldsgebruik. In het derde patroon ligt de nadruk op het vermogen om voortdurend oog te houden voor de mogelijkheden en beperkingen die ontstaan in de situatie, de handelingsopties die daaraan verbonden zijn en het inschatten van de handelingsopties van de ander. In deze verhalen komen emoties nauwelijks ter sprake. We menen dat deze patronen waarheden lijken te verbergen. In het eerste patroon appelleren jongeren aan een breder gedeeld idee over de ontoerekeningsvatbaarheid van emoties en plaatsen zij hun geweld buiten zichzelf. Dit verhult echter dat zij ook geweld gebruiken omdat ze er zich toe aangetrokken voelen en omdat ze het nodig achten. Het tweede patroon wordt alleen gebezigd door jongeren met een langdurige geschiedenis van geweld en een levensloop gekenmerkt door afwijzing: door ouders, op school en werk. De nadruk op het vermogen om geweldsituaties te beheersen verhult de machteloosheid waarmee zij in de rest van hun leven te kampen hebben.","Samenvatting: Bystanders play a crucial role in regulating public violence. In street fights, robberies, partner violence, and police violence, intervention is common, though its frequency, timing, and form vary. Video-based research shows that bystander actions depend on violence severity and perceived perpetrator motivations, suggesting that specific patterns prompt intervention. This paper explores interactional patterns in an underexamined form of violence: vigilante violence. Unlike other violent encounters, vigilante violence is often seen as legitimate, placing bystanders in a different role. Using 35 video-recorded incidents from public space cameras in Cape Town, South Africa, we analyze how often bystanders intervene, when they act, and how they do so. Findings show a high frequency of intervention, mainly occurring when violence becomes excessive. The most common intervention methods involve distracting the perpetrator and physically protecting the victim. Rather than stopping violence entirely, in vigilante violence bystanders aim to regulate it. This study highlights the nuanced role of bystanders across illegitimate and legitimate violence, and the need for more detailed understanding of the interactional patterns that drive intervention.","Samenvatting: Although harassment awareness training is identified as an effective tool to prevent gender-based violence, the reception of many of these programs is mixed. This article seeks to explain why responses to street harassment awareness training were much more antagonistic among female students of color in schools in disadvantaged areas than among mostly white girls in schools in more affluent areas. It draws from scholarship that examines the reception of policy and training programs through qualitative methods. The study is based on ethnographic observations of thirteen training sessions conducted by France’s leading anti-street harassment organization, Stop harcèlement de rue, as well as interviews with students, trainers, and high school staff. The findings show we cannot attribute differences in the reception of street harassment awareness-raising only to girls’ adherence or opposition to feminist values. Instead, this article shows how girls’ intersectional identities (in terms of race and class) informed to what extent seeing themselves as victims of street harassment conflicted with other dimensions of their identity. Popular media stereotypes about street harassment as a crime mainly committed by racialized minority men made it hard for racialized minority girls to blame perpetrators without feeling they were “betraying” their male peers. Girls in schools in more affluent areas, most of which were white, could denounce street harassment without feeling they were putting the blame on their male classmates. Based on these findings, the article questions whether raising awareness on street harassment rather than gender-based violence more broadly, is an effective prevention strategy.","Samenvatting: This study examines leisure and cultural participation patterns and profiles in Flanders using theories of cultural capital, social stratification, cultural omnivorousness and voraciousness. The research addresses questions about stability and change in participation profiles from 2004 to 2021, incorporating a focus on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using latent class analysis, we identified clusters based on participation in out-of-home cultural and broader leisure activities. Data were sourced from the Participation survey across multiple years (2004-2021). Four participation profiles emerged from 2004 to 2020: \"stay-at-homes,\" \"heritage and museum visitors,\" \"cultural browsers,\" and \"culture enthusiasts,\" distinguished by their levels and types of engagement. In 2020-2021, the profiles expanded to five, incorporating pandemic-specific leisure adaptations such as increased reliance on family-based and socially-oriented activities. Cultural omnivores and voracious participants exhibited shifts towards alternative activities due to limited access to cultural venues during the pandemic. Findings confirm the persistent role of social stratification in participation patterns, with higher education, urban living, and cultural socialisation predicting greater engagement. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the resilience of broader participation profiles, while also illustrating temporary shifts in leisure patterns, raising questions about post-pandemic trends. This study contributes to policy development by offering insights into barriers to cultural participation and the need for equitable access, especially for lower-educated, rural, and economically disadvantaged populations. It underscores the importance of fostering cultural capital and accessibility in shaping inclusive cultural and leisure policies.","Samenvatting: Cultural capital is thought to mark boundaries between groups and therefore changes in cultural participation are expected to lead to the formation of new social networks, in particular among upwardly mobile social groups (DiMaggio, 1982, 1987). Building further on empirical studies by Meuleman (2021), Lizardo (2006), Edelmann & Vaisy (2014), the research question of this paper reads: To what extent does cultural capital acquired in adulthood affect the social status of the social network? \r\nI will make use of data of the Dutch LISS (Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences) panel administered by Centerdata (Tilburg University, The Netherlands). The LISS panel is based on a random sample from the Dutch population among members of households aged 16 and older, with an initial response rate of 48%. The 7500 members of the panel (in 5000 households) are surveyed over a period of 14 years, annually about their cultural participation and their social networks. \r\nTo analyze these data, a combination is used of crossed-lagged panel models and fixed effects models, that combine the advantages of the two models (Allison, Williams & Moral Benito, 2017). Preliminary analyses in Stata on a 50% sample of the data set using the first four waves show different results between the cross-lagged effect models and models that control for unobserved heterogeneity. New analyses will be carried out for the presentation of the paper.\r\n\r\n","Samenvatting: The number of individuals who identify as 'spiritual' has grown significantly in Western Europe, but so far it remains unclear what spirituality entails and who these spiritual people are. Many scholars regard spirituality as a coherent worldview with common practices, specifically pocketed towards higher-educated individuals. Yet several findings hint at the existence of distinct spiritual subgroups, as reflected in varying spiritual preferences that seem to depend on educational level. With this study, we aim to explore whether this internal diversity within the spiritual milieu indeed exists, and if so, whether spirituality has become a new way for the higher-educated to distance themselves from the lower-educated. We will conduct a latent-class analysis with nationally representative Dutch LISS data (2009) that captures a great variety of spiritual beliefs, practices and experiences, allowing us to unravel distinct spiritual profiles. In a second step, we will employ regression analyses to examine whether these spiritual profiles are linked to educational level. All in all, this approach enables us to explore whether spiritual preferences have become a new form of capital distinguishing the higher-educated from the lower-educated in The Netherlands.","Samenvatting: What is the value of culture? While this question is often discussed in economic or artistic terms, it is clear that the social value of culture and cultural participation is equally significant. This study is part of a series of reports on the value of culture (economic, social, health-related and cognitive) and focuses on the social value of culture. In this study, the social value of culture is examined through a systematic literature review conducted on 95 peer-reviewed articles that were published between 2010 and 2024. Five key aspects were identified: social capital, social skills, social cohesion, social inclusion, and local image/community. The findings indicate that cultural consumption strengthens social capital, where bonding and bridging capital enhance social networks and mutual resources. Cultural consumption contributes to the development of social skills, such as communication, empathy, and cooperation, particularly among younger age groups and various socially vulnerable groups. Additionally, social cohesion is fostered through shared cultural experiences, which promote trust and collaboration within and between groups. Social inclusion is enhanced as cultural consumption reduces social isolation and increases the engagement of marginalized groups in society. Furthermore, culture plays a role in strengthening local image, identity, and community development. This study highlights that culture (and cultural consumption) makes a crucial social contribution, making it relevant beyond the cultural and artistic domains themselves. In the conclusion of the paper, we identify key research gaps concerning the social value of culture.","Samenvatting: Morele en politieke vraagstukken lijken de laatste 10 tot 15 jaar een steeds grotere impact te hebben op de waardering van kunst en cultuur. Door verschillende maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen worden culturele uitingen steeds vaker beoordeeld – en ook veroordeeld – om inhoudelijke redenen die te maken hebben met progressieve waardes. Denk aan kritiek op racistische stereotypen, de mannelijke blik op vrouwen, culturele toe-eigening, et cetera. Hoewel – grofweg sinds de negentiende eeuw – aan de relatief autonome kant van het artistieke veld esthetische oordelen waardevoller worden geacht dan ethische (Bourdieu), wordt dit dogma steeds meer ter discussie gesteld. \r\nVeel van deze kritiek wordt geuit op sociale media, maar heeft ook impact in het artistieke veld zelf. Mijn presentatie focust op de weerslag van deze ontwikkelingen in professionele recensies, ‘poortwachters’ in het veld. Recensenten zijn bemiddelaars tussen maker en publiek en medebepalen artistieke waarde. Ze weerspiegelen én vormen discoursen rond kunst. \r\nDe casus zijn filmrecensies in Nederlandse reguliere media (wellicht in een later stadium uit te breiden, zowel naar culturele discipline als geografisch). Door middel van een inhoudsanalyse van een selectie van recensies uit de afgelopen decennia wil ik achterhalen of er daadwerkelijk een verschuiving heeft plaatsgevonden in de balans tussen esthetische en ethische oordelen. Interviews met hedendaagse recensenten voegen hier de blik van de betrokkenen aan toe: hoe reflecteren zij op hun oordelen in het verleden en heden? Aangezien het empirisch onderzoek op moment van indienen nog moet plaatsvinden, kan ik in dit abstract nog geen bevindingen benoemen.\r\n","Samenvatting: In recent years, energy poverty has received significant attention in the public debate. Its prevalence and depth have been well documented, but less is known about the experiences of people living in energy poverty and those who try to assist them. This paper builds on theatre-based workshops that brought together people living in energy poverty and professionals who aim to support them. This project explored the meaning of living in energy poverty, strategies to deal with higher energy prices, and the interactions between professionals and clients. Results show that people in energy poverty do not experience it as a distinct form of poverty. The interactions between professionals and clients similarly did not reflect specific-energy poverty-related issues – although energy was often the reason for initiating contact. Rather, what mattered to clients was sensitive communication and feeling heard. For social workers, the workshops offered lessons in the experiences of being approached by professionals. This paper concludes that, in terms of energy poverty, it is important to pay attention to the price of energy and energy sufficiency of households; policy should not single it out but rather integrate it into structural poverty alleviation policy, including home improvement and income support. In terms of interactions, it concludes that mutual support, patience, and a lack of judgment are essential for successful social engagement. In terms of methods, theatre methods reveal deep-felt experiences of poverty and social-work interactions and provide immediate learning for service providers and clients.","Samenvatting: Transgender individuals worldwide face complex challenges, including limited access to healthcare, structural exclusion, and pervasive transphobia. However, a predominant problem-driven focus in research and media often amplifies these issues, overshadowing other vital aspects of trans identities, such as desires, joy, and community-building. This paper adopts a desire-driven approach (Tuck, 2009) to explore how healthcare and overall wellbeing for transgender youth in The Hague, The Netherlands, can be improved. Using Community-Led Research and Action (CLRA), an innovative and co-creative anthropological method, five transgender youth conducted research within their own communities. Through traditional qualitative methods, such as interviews, and creative expression through art, this study highlights the experiences, aspirations, and needs of trans youth. Key themes emerging from the research include access to care, the importance of community, and the celebration of trans joy. Our research revealed practical and systemic barriers, including a pressing need for improved access to counseling led by peers with lived experience and a stronger presence of trans professionals in healthcare. Additionally, participants expressed a desire for accessible social spaces tailored to their needs and emphasized the value of informal networks for sharing knowledge and support. Financial assistance was also identified as critical, with participants struggling to access resources necessary for gender-affirming care and daily living. By centering trans youth as knowledge producers, this study contributes to creating a more inclusive care system and a narrative that values the full complexity of trans identities.","Samenvatting: Kwalitatief onderzoek naar de ervaringen en perspectieven van moeilijk bereikbare groepen, zoals anderstalige nieuwkomers of sociaal gemarginaliseerde gemeenschappen, wordt vaak gehinderd door methodologische uitdagingen. Traditionele interviewtechnieken, die sterk afhankelijk zijn van taal, schieten tekort in het blootleggen van de complexiteit en gelaagdheid van hun leefwereld. Dit resulteert niet alleen in wetenschappelijke blinde vlekken, maar draagt ook bij aan de structurele ondervertegenwoordiging van deze groepen in academisch en beleidsmatig onderzoek.\r\nDit onderzoek introduceert Illustration Elicitation, een innovatieve methode die gebruikmaakt van visuele stimuli—specifiek ontworpen illustratiekaarten— als middel om de stem van participanten te versterken en om hen in staat te stellen hun ervaringen op een toegankelijke en betekenisvolle manier te verwoorden. Door semigestructureerde interviews te combineren met de illustratiekaarten, biedt deze benadering een methodologisch kader dat toelaat taalbarrières te overbruggen, complexere narratieven te ontsluiten en diepere inzichten te verschaffen.\r\nDe eerste empirische toepassing van deze methode richt zich op OKAN-leerlingen (onthaalklassen voor anderstalige nieuwkomers). De centrale onderzoeksvraag richt zich op de mogelijkheden en beperkingen die jongeren ervaren binnen de context van hun vrijetijdsbeleving en cultuureducatie in Vlaanderen.\r\nIllustration Elicitation wordt gepositioneerd binnen de traditie van de visuele sociologie en steunt op Bourdieu’s theorie van cultureel kapitaal. De methode functioneert niet alleen als een instrument om communicatiebarrières te overbruggen, maar maakt deel uit van een bredere paradigmaverschuiving binnen sociaalwetenschappelijk onderzoek.\r\nDeze benadering problematiseert structurele en symbolische uitsluitingsmechanismen die de sociaal-culturele participatie van gemarginaliseerde jongeren beperken. Het onderzoek stelt dat Illustration Elicitation niet slechts een alternatief is voor conventionele methoden, maar een noodzakelijke uitbreiding binnen kwalitatief onderzoek.\r\nDeze studie bespreekt de theoretische en praktische implicaties van deze methode, reflecteert op de kansen en beperkingen en pleit voor een herdefiniëring van onderzoekstradities waarin visuele methoden niet langer als louter complementair worden beschouwd, maar fundamenteel bijdragen aan de representatie en erkenning van gemarginaliseerde stemmen.\r\n\r\n","Samenvatting: It is becoming increasingly common for researchers to study social phenomena from an interpersonal perspective, using data gathered from a round-robin design, in which each member of a group (e.g., a nuclear family, classroom, or team of employees) provides data about every other member. For example, each student in a classroom can indicate how much they like each other student. Dyadic data from this design have a complex underlying structure because each dyad is cross-nested within both members, given that each of N members provides information about N − 1 members, as well as having information provided about them by N − 1 members. The social relations model (SRM) was designed to decompose interpersonal perceptions (or behaviors) into random effects associated with perceivers (or actors), targets (or partners), and the uniqueness of particular relationships. The primary outcomes of an SRM analysis involve the estimated covariance matrices at the personal level (individual differences in actor and partner effects, and how they are correlated within persons) and the dyad level (e.g., how relationship-specific behaviors differ across dyads, given person-level effects). Thus, it is conceptually possible to model complex associations among multiple round-robin variables by fitting a structural equation model (SEM) to model the covariance structure at one or both levels of interest. This presentation will showcase an in-progress R package that facilitates a 2-step approach: (1) estimating a multivariate SRM using MCMC estimation and (2) using the lavaan package to fit an SEM with ML estimation.","Samenvatting: Bayesian methods have been gaining popularity in a variety of areas of research, leading to methodological advancements in areas such as Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM). The Bayesian framework can be useful in experimental psychology, can improve estimation with small samples, can identify unknown change-points in genetic studies, or can evaluate measurement invariance in a more flexible way. User-friendly software, such as the R package blavaan have improved accessibility to advanced Bayesian methods. Here we will present some analysis that can be done with the package blavaan. Such as Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and Structural Equation Models (SEM). These can be model with continuous or categorical indicators. We will present a case study, as a workflow example. Building a Bayesian measurement model, evaluating global and local model fit, selection of priors, adding predictors, and compare models. This way we will present a the application of Bayesian SEM in an open-source package, and how this can be extended.","Samenvatting: Latent Class Analysis (LCA) is a widely used method in social science research for identifying unobserved subgroups in a population. However, the computational speed of conducting LCA remains a significant challenge, especially with large datasets and complex models. In these scenarios, a single analysis may take hours or days to converge using commercial software, and even longer with some open-source alternatives. The latent package is an open-source R solution that addresses these shortcomings by providing fast C++ implementations of the LCA equations and optimization techniques. It also supports parallel computations of these optimization algorithms, offering even greater speed when models are prone to local minima and require multiple starting values to identify the global minimum. In summary, latent is designed to efficiently handle large-scale datasets and complex models, making it an ideal choice both for applied researchers needing rapid, scalable solutions and for methodologists conducting large-scale simulations. This presentation will highlight the package's performance in accelerating LCA estimation, demonstrating its ability to deliver results in seconds rather than minutes or hours, and showcasing its potential for both large-scale simulation studies and real-world applications.","Samenvatting: As ethnic diversity increases in Western countries, concerns about negative outgroup attitudes and interethnic polarization are growing. In diverse classrooms, interacting processes such as peer influence, homophily, and attitude-based friend selection contribute to changing outgroup attitudes. This study explores if and when individual attitude shifts driven by these processes might scale up to intergroup hostility in empirical multiethnic school cohorts that initially have a rather positive interethnic climate. Using an agent-based model calibrated with longitudinal network and attitude data, we conduct a series of computational experiments to assess the effects of hypothetical macro-level shocks, such as violent incidents or inflammatory political speeches. Leveraging publicly available data from the “Friendship and Identity in Schools” project, we examine secondary school cohorts in a diverse German region. As a baseline, we use a model fitted to longitudinal data on the co-evolution of intergroup attitudes and friendship relations in two different school cohorts. Then, we use the empirically calibrated model as a simulation tool to evaluate longer-term consequences of effects external shocks could have on the relative strength of social influence on outgroup attitudes and on ethnic homophily in friendship selection. Our findings indicate that peer influence, when intensified by an external shock, can over time magnify even small outgroup biases, leading to affective polarization. This dynamic is accelerated under strong ethnic homophily. We further provide a detailed analysis of how these results emerge from the empirical context and the interacting processes included in the model.","Samenvatting: When operating as interviewers, Large Language Models have great potential in enriching data collection on opinions, values and attitudes common in social scientific study. Instead of asking a survey question with fixed response categories, individual attitudes can be collected at scale while allowing for the nuance and conversation characteristic of qualitative interviews. These ‘chatbot interviews’ can be easily integrated into existing survey designs, yielding both representative and in-depth information. When combined with text analysis techniques (e.g. topic modeling), chatbot interviews have the potential to resolve “the trade-off between depth and scale” (Wuttke et al. 2024:1) that has plagued opinion studies for decades. While there is much to be done to establish such a new method for data collection, we break the ice by  (a) comparing the performance of chatbot interviewers to human (student) interviewers and (b) evaluating the theoretical sensitivity of chatbot interviewers. Using the open-source Python package boterviewer. developed to conduct chatbot interviews and experiment with prompts, we set up an interview experiment on a convenience sample of 27 university students and staff. We provide the model with a short questionnaire on Universal Basic Income, vary conditions with and without a short background on deservingness theory. Based on both a qualitative content analysis and quantitative text-analytical metrics, we compare the theoretical relevance of follow-up questions, the sensitivity to theoretical cues, and the effectiveness in eliciting theoretically relevant answers. First (very) preliminary results suggest that theory prompts indeed improve the theoretical relevance of follow-up questions asked by chatbot interviewers. Further analysis of the data still have to be performed.","Samenvatting: Territorial stigma has intensified in the past decades due to economic shifts, spatial segregation, stigmatizing policies, populist politics, and media portrayals. Newspaper media play a dominant role in (re)producing and circulating negative representations of neighborhoods. This study will focus on the Bijlmer, one of the most well-known and ‘notorious’ areas in the Netherlands. The aim of this study is to show how the Bijlmer is portrayed in newspaper media, how these representations change across time and what might explain these changes. Theoretical perspectives on urban change and media systems are both included. A large corpus is build including articles on the Bijlmer from the five largest newspapers between 1990-2024. Quantitative methods (computational text analysis) and qualitative methods (content analysis) are used to analyze this corpus. This presentation will focus on the work in progress, outlining some of the potential benefits and challenges relating to corpus building and textual analysis. Ultimately, the study aims to unravel how and why areas become (de)stigmatized.","Samenvatting: Social norms are often thought to emerge because they benefit those who follow them. Yet, the persistence of  “unpopular norms”—behavioral regularities that endure despite being privately rejected by most—challenges this assumption. Examples include foot binding in historical China, child marriage, and entrenched patterns of bribery and corruption. How can we explain the emergence of such norms?\r\nWe argue that the structure of social networks plays a crucial role in the emergence of unpopular norms by magnifying the “majority illusion” paradox. Even when a behavior is globally rare, certain network structures can cause individuals to perceive that most of their neighbors conform to it, creating the false impression that it is more widespread than it truly is. This illusion, when coupled with network externalities, can ripple through the network, pushing the population toward widespread compliance with an unpopular norm. \r\nOur agent-based simulations reveal that network structure not only magnifies this illusion but also facilitates its spread under conditions of incomplete information and simplified decision-making heuristics. While most network configurations allow the majority to resist the spread of an unpopular norm pushed by a few fanatics, specific structures—characterized by fat-tailed degree distributions, disassortative mixing, and strong degree-trait correlation—enable these fanatics to sway the majority into compliance.\r\nTo empirically validate this mechanism, we conduct a large-scale incentivized social network experiment involving an asymmetric coordination game on experimentally manipulated networks. I will present the simulation results, describe the experimental design, and—if data is available by then—discuss the experimental findings.","Samenvatting: Gender inequality in scientific careers has been documented in a variety of outcomes including access to professor positions, career length, scientific impact, and productivity. Much less is known about the careers of scholars who leave academia at some point. This is an important knowledge gap, since the majority of those who obtain a PhD will not keep working in academia. Furthermore, women PhDs leave the university at higher rates than men, and while this has thus far been assumed to be a negative outcome, the (gendered) effects of this transition out of academia are understudied. The consequences of transitions later in the career are especially unknown. Our paper addresses this knowledge gap by studying the salary development of men and women PhDs over a period up to 17 years. To do so, we use survey data from 21,350 individuals who obtained doctorate at universities in the Netherlands, linked to Dutch register data on salaries, job characteristics and family composition. Because we have access to detailed information about doctoral recipients’ jobs, we are able to pinpoint the transition out of academia and analyse its impact on salary trajectories. We further enrich our findings by testing whether different push and pull factors (i.e. temporary employment, work hours, having a young child, disciplinary background) can help to explain why men and women’s salaries may develop differently following a transition out of academia. Consequently, we provide a detailed but nuanced account of gender inequality in researchers’ careers beyond academia in the Netherlands.","Samenvatting: The expansion of administrative and big data and the increase in the survey's non-responses have highlighted the relevance of assessing the quality of non-probability samples. To tackle this issue, people usually resort to the Total Error (TE) framework, which divides the error into a measurement and a representation component. Extensive literature focuses on measurement error, often using a combination of data from different sources to evaluate whether the observed variables adequately capture the concept intended to be measured. Another branch of the literature has centered on the representation error, assessing how respondents are selected in the sample, leading to systematic differences between the population and the observed units. However, research modeling both of these components simultaneously is still scant. In the present study, we address this gap by jointly modeling the measurement and the representation errors, combining recent advances in both areas. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate our TE model under different specifications of measurement and representation errors. Additionally, we performed a case study analysis using a combination of Italian administrative registers and the Labor Force Survey (LFS) to evaluate the TE in the income variable. Our preliminary results show that our model adequately captures the different error sources and provides a good strategy for assessing the TE when using a combination of probability and non-probability data.","Samenvatting: There exists great heterogeneity regarding both the definition and the operationalization of employment precariousness (EP) in the current literature. Due to the lack of consensus on what EP entails, there is an unfulfilled need for a universally recognized definition and operationalization of EP.  Consquently, authors use operationalizations based on available data. The literature on EP can be roughly divided into two approaches: one of which relates to the objective contractual arrangement (objective EP) and the other to an individual’s experience (subjective EP). However, it remains unclear how theoretically and data-driven definitions of EP, align with user-generated discussion of EP ‘in the wild’. In this study, we analyze discourse on BlueSky to explore how prevalent user-generated topics related to EP compare with both objective and subjective conceptualizations of EP. We apply Bi-term Topic modeling on user-generated data from BlueSky to identify a number of k latent employment-related topics. Our preliminary results demonstrate that the dimensions in the EPRES scale are not in alignment with the topics regarding EP discussed in online discourse","Samenvatting: Digital trace data are increasingly used across the social and behavioral sciences. They allow researchers to access large volumes of highly detailed and continuous information, often in real-time. Such scale and speed can not be achieved when using traditional sources, such as surveys. Digital traces are also believed to overcome some of the limitations that surveys are criticized for. However, while the use of digital traces undoubtedly presents researchers with new possibilities, it also introduces new quality challenges that have been increasingly acknowledged in recent years. Accounting for these limitations is crucial, as they can lead to biased results and incorrect research findings. Therefore, in this paper, we apply hidden Markov models (HMMs) to digital trace data on Facebook use to assess the nature and incidence of error in measures of Facebook use frequency. HMMs are an attractive method that allows for the estimation and correction of error without the availability of (error-free) gold-standard data. Our results suggest that the measures derived from digital trace data severely underestimate the frequency of Facebook use for a third of our sample, in particular when not all relevant devices are tracked.","Samenvatting: The substudy within the ENGINE project we will propose evaluates the effects of diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) policies of higher education institutions (HEIs) on promoting an inclusive diversity climate. Previous studies have shown that\r\nsuch a climate makes a crucial contribution to narrowing the ethnic gap. The two disconnected research strands on the effectiveness of institutional DEI policies have very different traditions and evaluation approaches. Critical race and\r\ndiversity studies tend to be skeptical about the positive effects of current DEI policies in HEIs (Campion et al., 2021; Ahmed, 2006; Bhopal 2020) whereas social psychology and organizational studies are more optimistic. To evaluate the\r\neffects of DEI policies on reducing the ethnic gap we need to 1) better understand the contributions of different types of policies and their different contexts, and 2) explore the relationship between DEI policies and diversity climates.\r\nIn the first phase of this research, the existing formal DEI-policies in Flemish HEIs will be described and categorized. In a later phase, different types of DEI policies will also be correlated with the results of a survey of students on diversity\r\nclimates and the ethnic gap. At later stages, we will also describe and explain contextual factors for successful implementation of good practices and inquire into possibilities of successful policy transfer.\r\nDuring the conference session, the first phase of the research will be presented. Here, the methodology used, and the preliminary findings will be explained. In addition, an overview of the next steps within the research process will be presented","Samenvatting: A more inclusive diversity environment requires lecturers to create inclusive learning environments. Academic research shows that when teachers adjust their attitudes and teaching methods to respond to diversity, ethnic minority students\r\nachieve better academic results and develop higher levels of belonging (Florian, 2015; Wah & Nasri, 2019). Most studies on inclusive teaching practices and lecturer professionalization focus on compulsory education and have been conducted in\r\nAnglo-Saxon contexts. However, little is known about this in continental Europe and higher education institutions. Therefore, there is an urgent need for research on the effectiveness of professionalization to strengthen the inclusive skills of higher education lecturers. This contributes to the development of strategies for a more inclusive educational landscape and a better understanding of how different types of lecturer professionalization can contribute to this. A trajectory was established with various stakeholders following the principles of educational design research (Reeves et al., 2011) to develop a professionalization program for higher education teachers. The core of the program focuses on promoting cultural awareness, cultural knowledge and intercultural skills to better equip lecturers for a super-diverse educational context. The program consists of two modules: in module 1, the focus is on understanding diversity in their classroom practices, their own positionality and frames of references. In module 2, we focus on teaching how to effectively manage diversity in their teaching practices and interactions. During this session, the first draft of the professionalization program will be presented. Participants are invited to actively think about further development and implementation.","Samenvatting: The increasing ethnic-cultural diversity in higher education has been accompanied by a rise in the formation of ethnic minority student organizations (EMSOs) on campus. While previous research has demonstrated that student organizations may contribute to the overall wellbeing and sense of belonging of higher education students on campus, their potential to reduce the ethnic gap remains understudied, particularly in the European context. This presentation reports on the initial findings from participatory action research conducted with 4 EMSOs operating within Flemish higher education institutions. The research seeks to examine the impact of EMSOS on ethnic inequality by (1) describing, explaining and measuring the influence of a variety of EMSOs, and (2) assessing the effectiveness of their activities in addressing the ethnic gap. By observing and collaborating with these organizations, this study sheds light on their capacity to support ethnic minority students and challenge systemic inequalities.","Samenvatting: Student organizations in higher education institutions (HEIs) are significant agents of socialization. They play a pivotal role in shaping students’ academic, social, and civic experiences, as well as their identity construction as young adults. This\r\npresentation shares the initial survey findings from the Engaged4Equality project, which investigates ethno-racialized students’ perceptions, choices, and motivations regarding their (non-)membership in various types of student organizations,\r\nincluding socio-cultural groups, political groups, identity-oriented organizations, and program-oriented organizations. We are particularly interested in understanding how their membership - or lack thereof- in these organizations influences\r\nand mediates students’ academic and social inclusion within higher education. By exploring the factors that drive their decisions, the presentation seeks to uncover the barriers and opportunities that shape participation in student organizations\r\nand their role in fostering inclusive campus environments.","Samenvatting: This paper seeks to explore interactions between the parents’ and child protection services, in the years after family reunion. Initial research suggests that parents experience ‘being lost in translation’ in multiple ways. Parents’ report that they do not understand what is happening at the time of the intervention, that it takes time for them to realize what the problem is in their family and how this is evaluated (differently) by authorities and professionals. Parents that reunited their families after years of being separated, struggle with questions on how they could have prevented intervention, how they can heal what is broken, and how they can realize a stable family life.\r\nThis paper is informed by a small pilot study that emerged out of a collaboration between the authors with experts and intercultural mediators from the Dutch- Eritrean community. This enabled a participatory action research design, project  that that resulted in narrative interviews with four Eritrean migrant parents and 4 intercultural mediators that assisted these and other parents in their interaction with (child protection) authorities.  \r\nIn this paper we problematize deficit-oriented approaches towards refugee parenting in recently reunited families. We argue the need for a) a better understanding of how parenting in recently reunited families is situated in the context of Dutch and Eritrean parenting practices, 2) the complexities and precarities in family systems in the context of rupture, instability and change, 3) the challenges that these families (parents and children) are experiencing in integrating and finding stability in The Netherlands. Finally, we explore what a better understanding of parents’ and children’s hopes and aspirations for the future can offer for transforming violence and instability in the context of the challenges that recently reunited families experience.          \r\n","Samenvatting: Global migratory flows have revealed both the reluctance of host societies to accept these movements and the increasing tendency for human displacement, as the factors driving people to migrate have also broadened. While early studies on migration predominantly focused on its causes and the agency of individuals in seeking improved socioeconomic conditions, contemporary research increasingly acknowledges the influence of structural determinants pushing migration, including armed conflicts and the adverse effects of climate change. Building on this premise, the present study shifts the analytical focus towards host societies. From this perspective, immigrant integration raises questions about social cohesion in host societies when migrants arrive. In this context, religious affiliation can become a significant indicator of belonging in contemporary societies, as studies have shown the role of religious institutions in fostering these connections. However, religiosity can positively and negatively affect attitudes toward migrants, depending on the religious beliefs and the context. \r\nAccordingly, this study aims to provide new insights into the relationship between religion, migration, and social cohesion by investigating the role of religiosity and religious affiliation in fostering social trust among nationals and migrants in Chile, a topic that has been poorly researched by the Chilean academy. It hypothesizes that Chileans who identify as Catholic or Evangelical will, on average, show higher levels of social trust—one dimension of social cohesion—toward migrants.","Samenvatting: This research examines how the perception of religiosity across three generations influences attitudes towards the “other” in Turkey, specifically Alevis, homosexuals, and Syrian immigrants. The study uses a qualitative approach, with semi-structured interviews conducted with 30 individuals from 10 families, representing three generations of the same family. The aim is to understand how different generations perceive religiosity and how these perceptions shape their views on the \"other.\". The first and second generations view religiosity as fulfilling formal religious obligations, whereas the third generation interprets it through moral and social values. A more rigid interpretation of religion correlates with a more distant attitude towards the \"other.\" While the first and second generations prefer to maintain a certain distance from Alevis and even do not consider them Muslims, the third generation is indifferent to whether someone is Alevi or not. Most first and second-generation participants expressed hesitation towards having a gay neighbor or colleague, justifying their views with religious reasoning. In contrast, some third-generation participants, unlike their families, view homosexuality as a natural process and would not be bothered by having a gay neighbor or colleague. These differences in perspective on the \"other\" are notably evident even within the same family. The first generation interprets helping them more as a religious responsibility, while the third generation expresses that they would do so simply because they are human. Additionally, the third generation complains about the large number of Syrians in the country although they do not exclude them because of their race","Samenvatting: A generative line of inquiry, among the array of studies that the concept of ‘superdiversity’ has inspired, has been to investigate the micro-politics of encounters with social differences in everyday spaces of cities. The insight that ‘the everyday’ is an important domain in which social power is renewed and resisted has been used to analyze the development of solidarities between social groups and fault lines between them. This paper advances this everyday approach to superdiversity studies by bringing it in dialogue with the framework of ‘social aesthetics’. It argues that the lens of social aesthetics brings into view two related ways in which the aesthetic dimensions of superdiversity operates in the everyday city: 1) as a mode of organizing ethnicities in relation to whiteness, and 2) as sensorial judgements about national cultural identity. To develop these arguments, this paper draws on participant observation in a dense mixed-use space in Rotterdam – a site which includes a high-rise apartment complex, a busy train station, a high-end indoor food hall and a bi-weekly outdoor farmers’ market – and in-depth ethnographic interviews with residents and users of this space. The framework of social aesthetics allows everyday studies of superdiversity to move beyond a singular focus on the two social outcomes of majority-minority cities – does superdiversity increase or hinder solidarity? – to conceptualize superdiversity as a lived aesthetic category that mediates the relationship between city and nation.","Samenvatting: There is a growing need to understand how increasing diversity affects urban life. Little attention is however given to new towns, such as Almere. After the three largest cities, Almere is the most diverse in the Netherlands, yet unlike those older cities, there is much less segregation and inequality. The research was conducted with interviews (50 interviewees) and a survey (more than 700 respondents) and builds on a previous study. The results focus on social position and diversity. The practical middle class, the largest socio-economic group in Almere, remains vulnerable to changes in the labour market but often manages to adapt. Young people experience barriers to entering the housing market. The share of skilled migrants and labour migrants is increasing. The neighbourhoods are becoming more diverse, and more households are sharing houses that were originally built as single-family dwellings. \r\nDespite concerns about neighbourhood deterioration and safety, residents appreciate the green surroundings, the existing social networks, and a perceived individual freedom of living. Residents of different backgrounds but similar social positions respect each other and give each other space. Casual, uncomplicated interaction characterises everyday diversity. These qualities remain largely obscured. New towns are famous for polarization, but political opinion seems to form largely outside of the context of daily life in the streets. Moreover, local governments put their problems first in the battle for government funding. And regrettably, prejudice about the planned design of new towns hides their social qualities from view.\r\n","Samenvatting: De afgelopen jaren heeft de groeiende etnische en religieuze diversiteit in West-Europese steden, waaronder Belgische grootsteden, aanzienlijke uitdagingen blootgelegd in het voldoen aan de begrafeniswensen van religieuze minderheidsgroepen, in het bijzonder moslims. Hoewel de afgelopen decennia geleidelijk aan meer mogelijkheden zijn ontwikkelend voor religieuze minderheden om (gedeeltelijk) in overeenstemming met hun religieuze voorschriften begraven te worden, bestaan er nog steeds aanzienlijke juridische en praktische obstakels waarmee moslims geconfronteerd worden. De afwezigheid van eeuwige grafrust wordt beschouwd als een belangrijke redenen waarom veel moslims kiezen voor repatriëring naar hun (islamitisch) land van herkomst, maar ook familiebanden, sociale uitsluiting en ervaringen met discriminatie spelen een rol in de beslissing. Tegelijkertijd suggereren verschillende bronnen een afname van het aantal repatriëringen, wat duidt op een groeiende behoefte aan lokale begraafplaatsen voor moslims.\r\nDit onderzoek analyseert de funeraire behoeften van moslims in Vlaanderen en de uitdagingen die hiermee gepaard gaan voor de uitvaartsector. Centraal staan de volgende vragen: Wat zijn de begrafenisnoden van moslims in Vlaanderen? Welke uitdagingen ervaren zij en de betrokken actoren in de uitvaartsector? Op welke manieren spelen verschillende stakeholders hier al dan niet op in? In deze presentatie bespreek ik de preliminaire bevindingen op basis van diepte-interviews met verschillende professionals uit de uitvaartsector, zoals (moslim)begrafenisondernemers, begraafplaatsbeheerders en non-profitorganisaties. Ik bespreek de uitdagingen die ervaren worden door de verschillende professionals en belicht de spanningen rond de creatie en zichtbaarheid van begraafperken voor moslims. Daarnaast zal ik de gelegenheid benutten om feedback en reflecties van de aanwezige onderzoekers te verzamelen. \r\n","Samenvatting: The number of older migrants in the Netherlands is increasing rapidly, especially among first-generation non-Western migrants. In 1990, there were only 20,000 migrants aged 65 and older, but this number has risen to 180,000 and is expected to reach 550,000 by 2050. Retirement poverty is a significant issue, with around 40% of this group facing financial struggles. A study using 26 qualitative interviews with retirees from Morocco, Suriname, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, and Turkey explored how they manage their economic situation.\r\nThe research revealed four main themes. First, many participants lacked knowledge about their financial situation until they reached retirement. Communication from pension institutions was often seen as late and complicated, although those who worked for larger organizations received more useful and timely information, which helped them adjust their retirement plans. Second, most retirees stopped working before reaching retirement age, usually due to health issues, and working beyond 67 was not considered a viable solution. Their retirement savings were generally low, either due to limited financial knowledge or because saving was not financially feasible. Even those who had some savings didn’t set them aside specifically for retirement. Third, many retirees didn’t use the social security benefits (AIO) available to them. Some refused to apply, seeing the conditions as humiliating, distrusting the authorities, or considering it 'un-Islamic.' Others simply didn’t understand the regulations. Help from children played a role in some cases. Finally, while a few participants remained in contact with their home countries, few sent or received money. Informal support was rare, except from children, though this could be complicated. These findings offer important insights for both policymakers and researchers.","Samenvatting: Research on religion's role in immigrant integration in Europe has largely focused on (predominantly Sunni) Muslims, the largest religious minority. This study broadens the scope by comparing Surinamese Muslims not only to Surinamese Christians but also to Hindus—a global religious tradition without historical roots in the destination country. While Islam often faces public suspicion or hostility, Hinduism encounters less controversy and sometimes even Orientalist curiosity. Migration scholars describe Hinduism as an \"ethnic religion\" in the context of twice-migration from the Caribbean to Europe, highlighting its role in community formation and political organization. Given this background, we investigate whether religiosity can be conceptualized similarly across Surinamese Christians, Muslims, and Hindus in the Netherlands. We then analyze how individual religious involvement relates to integration into Dutch society across these traditions. We hypothesize that religiosity is less linked to integration among Surinamese Hindus than among Muslims and that it serves a weaker bridging function than it does for Christians. To test this, we employ multiple-group structural equation modeling. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for research and theory on religion’s role in immigrant integration in an increasingly secular yet historically Christian Europe.","Samenvatting: This paper argues that the usual focus on why people migrate is insufficient to fully understand the real-life complexities of migration. Instead, a genuine understanding of migration as a ‘total social fact’ (or a continuous social process) requires the simultaneous examination of why people migrate to particular places but also why they do not migrate elsewhere. Elaborating on Mabogunje’s migration systems theory as well as Bourdieu and Sayad’s conceptualisation of migration as a ‘total social fact’, this paper outlines a conceptual framework for analysing these three foundational questions by situating individuals within the broader social systems that shape and are shaped by migration. Using the case of Algerian migration to France, the paper demonstrates how colonial legacies have not only sustained migration along well-trodden migration corridors, but also impeded the development of alternative migration systems. The paper concludes by arguing how this dynamic has neutralised aspirations and capabilities not only to move but also choose certain destinations over others, revealing the conceptual need to view migration systems as a ‘field of practice’ where knowledge, power, and agency interact.\r\n","Samenvatting: This study examines how individual values influence intra-group relationships among highly skilled Chinese migrants in Germany. By integrating Schwartz’s theory of individual and cultural values with Heinich’s pragmatic approach to valuation, it explores how values formed through early socialisation in China—shaped by deeply ingrained cultural frameworks and reinforced by political legacies—continue to structure relational patterns in migration contexts. Based on in-depth interviews with 62 highly skilled Chinese migrants, the findings reveal an atomised community: while cultural familiarity facilitates initial social connections, power and security values undermine trust and collective support. These values, rooted in hierarchical social structures and sustained through governance mechanisms, shape risk-conscious and self-preserving relational strategies, including opportunism, risk-avoidance, and selective trust. Consequently, intra-group cohesion is weakened, limiting the community’s capacity to navigate challenges in German society. By demonstrating how these historically embedded values are reproduced in migration contexts, this study contributes to migration research in three ways. First, it challenges the assumption that co-ethnic, highly skilled migrants naturally form a cohesive and supportive community. Second, it reveals how Legalist governance and pseudo-individualism shape intra-group atomisation beyond national borders. Third, it extends value theory by integrating Heinich’s processual approach to valuation with Schwartz’s structural model of value priorities, offering a context-sensitive analysis of how values are enacted, negotiated, and reproduced in transnational migration settings.","Samenvatting: Migrants & the military: more afraid of war, less supportive of strengthening the army\r\nJelle Lössbroek NIDI-KNAW / University of Groningen\r\nGovernments across Europe are planning to expand their armies and increase military spending. Will their populations support this? During the Cold War, European populations supported a larger role for the military, but current populations have a markedly different demography. Specifically, a far larger share of the population consists of migrants. Why would migrants have different attitudes than non-migrants?\r\nMigrants may be more supportive of the military if they experienced armed conflict themselves, or their country did recently, showcasing the importance of defense; many migrants are from countries with more traditional attitudes, which envision a larger role for the military.\r\nAlternatively, migrants may be less supportive, as they may have experienced more abusive behavior by the military, have less patriotic feelings supportive of the military; have the option of ‘returning home’ in case of a crisis.\r\nThe study uses a combination of cross-country surveys conducted between 2015-2024. Preliminary results show that migrants are more afraid than natives that war will come to their new host country. However, they have less confidence in the army, less willing to fight for their new host country should war come, more often feel that defense budgets are too high, less often feel that defense budgets are too low, less likely to want to invest in defense against Russia, and less likely to want to provide military support to Ukraine. Generally, differences are small, however.","Samenvatting: The European Social Survey (ESS) is a rich but to many an intimidating source on educational attainment. From its beginning, ESS has collected independent information on qualification and duration as measures of level of education. While the questionnaire format on duration has remained unchanged over all rounds, qualification has been measured in country-specific codes that have changed between rounds and have been post-harmonized in a bewildering number of different ways: EDULVLa, EDULVLb, EISCED. ESS has pioneered the implementation of ISCED-2011 (even before the final introduction of the classification) but has used a survey-specific variety of this standard classification which does not conform to UNESCO standards.\r\nAs a follow-up to earlier analyses of the measurement of education in ESS (Schröder & Ganzeboom, 2014; Ganzeboom & Schröder, 2016), this paper explains the detailed story of education measurement in the ESS in R1-R10 and examines the relative quality of the various measurement, using a latent-variable measurement model with qualification and duration as independent measures of the underlying level of education. We find that duration has surprisingly high measurement quality (only slightly lower that the most detailed version of qualification measurement that takes all country-specific details into account), also in countries with strongly stratified education systems, such as the Netherlands and Germany. Finally, it is shown that that double indicator measurement – by both qualifications and duration – repairs both validity and reliability problems.\r\n","Samenvatting: Human values from Schwartz’ seminal theory (Schwartz, 1992, 2012) have been used to describe differences between individuals and provide insight in their relationship with attitudes and behaviors. Values are found to be universal and although value priorities are different across countries (Schwartz & Bardi, 2001), similar value structures have been found across countries. Recent, the availability of panel data encouraged research in value change over time (Leijen et al. 2022). In the current study, using the European Social Survey (ESS), we investigate value change across five generations in 29 countries over 20 years (2002-2020). We expect these changes will not be similar across countries over time as contextual differences may affect individuals’ value development. \r\nIn Schwartz’ values theory, values are located on a theoretical circumplex with opposing and converging values. On a more general level, the values describe the dichotomy of the importance of group/individual, and change/conservation. Although scores on specific values are insightful, when analyzing value change over time it can be more insightful to look at all values simultaneously: As values are related, change in one value change also affects other values.\r\nTo estimate value change over time in the cross-sectional ESS data, following Beugelsdijk et al. (2022), we use archetype analysis (Cutler & Breiman, 1994; Eugster & Leisch, 2009). This approach allows us to describe all individuals in the data using a few distinct observations at the boundary of the datacloud. These few extreme observations are called archetypes and represent a specific combination of value scores. All other observations in the data can be represented as a linear combination of these archetypes. Archetypes are stable, making them suitable for monitoring change across groups and over time.\r\nUsing the human values in the ESS, we find 3 archetypes: Growth-focus, Self-focus, and Social-focus. Each archetype clearly shows the oppositions and compatibilities as in Schwartz’ theory. The Growth archetype considers benevolence and universalism of high importance, and power and achievement of low importance. The Self-focus archetype considers achievement and power as very important and universalism, benevolence, and tradition as unimportant. The Social-focus archetype considers security and tradition very important, and stimulation and hedonism unimportant.\r\nWe focus on value change between generations, across countries. Following Norris and Inglehart (2019), we distinguish 5 generations: Silent-generation, Baby-Boomers, Generation-X, Millennials, and Generation-Z. As expected in adults, changes in values due to time in the 20 years of the ESS are small but present. However, both between generations and between countries substantive changes in value priorities are found. Over generations, from Silent to X there is a strong increase in Self-focus and a decrease in Social-focus in people holding for all countries. Prevalence of Growth-focus is primarily explained by the political and economic situation in the country: The wealthier and more democratic a country in people's youth, the higher the prevalence of growth-focused individuals. Implications of our findings for both academics and practitioners will be discussed.","Samenvatting: Against the background of population ageing and policies to stimulate longer working lives, this study examines retirement income in Europe along well-established lines of social stratification: gender and education. Prior studies have shown that generous state pensions are able to alleviate poverty, that is, in countries that provide higher state pension income, poverty is less prevalent among the older population. However, it is unclear to what extent state pension systems are also able to alleviate social inequality in retirement income. Welfare state theories predict that especially social categories that are vulnerable to end up in poverty gain resources from welfare benefits. When thinking of such benefits, people commonly think of unemployment, disability or housing benefits, but old-age benefits in terms of state pension is also considered part of a country’s welfare provisions. Exploiting two decades of ESS data and within- and between-country variation in income as well as state pension generosity, the current study examines this open question by looking at differences in retirement income between men and women, and between the lower and higher educated. It also explores whether social inequality in retirement income has increased over time. What has been the impact of increases in statutory retirement ages? Have welfare austerity measures increased poverty rates? Have certain social categories been hit disproportionately? Answering these questions will identify social groups that face higher risks of poverty in old age and will provide clear policy implications regarding the design of state pension systems.","Samenvatting: The Netherlands Institute for Social Research (Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau, in collaboration with Tilburg University) is currently investigating how Dutch citizens’ personal values are changing over time. By analyzing data from ESS rounds 1-11, this study explores whether value priorities are converging or diverging across different social groups. We also study whether we can discern value types and whether value priorities and types coincide with socio-demographic characteristics (‘social sorting’).\r\nPersonal values are also widely considered to shape political beliefs (Rokeach, 1973 in Schwartz, 2014), but how exactly do they influence political opinions in the Netherlands? This research delves into the relationship between personal values and political attitudes on key issues like economic redistribution, climate change, immigration, and cultural liberalism. We explore whether different individuals can hold similar political views for different underlying reasons, driven by distinct value systems.\r\nIn this presentation, we will share our first set of findings, offering new insights into the social sorting of personal values and the connection between these values and political attitudes in the Netherlands.","Samenvatting: Who deserves international solidarity and help, and why? The Dutch government has recently decided to provide development aid only to countries and programs that directly serve Dutch interests in trade, security, and migration. But, what does the public think about when and why help should be given? This study examines the extent to which Dutch citizens believe their government should assist countries in Europe and Africa in different crisis situations, such as natural disasters, debt crises, refugee crises, epidemics, and war. We further explore the reasons for providing aid, comparing motivations based on self-interest (trade, safety, and migration) with humanitarian considerations. Using clustering methods, we identify distinct groups based on their response patterns regarding motivations and crisis scenarios. To address these questions, we collected survey data (n=2000) on international solidarity and humanitarian aid in the Netherlands (Global Citizenship in the Netherlands 2025). This study adds to the academic literature by offering new data on Dutch public opinion regarding international solidarity and humanitarian aid in 2025, and contributes to the ongoing debate about the influence of self-interests versus humanitarian values in shaping motivations for helping other countries. By explicitly differentiating between these motivations, and between countries in Europe or in Africa, this research enhances our understanding of public attitudes toward foreign aid. \r\n","Samenvatting: Inequality beliefs—beliefs about the causes of success in failure in society—have been identified as a key factor in shaping how people evaluate and respond to inequality. Those who strongly believe in meritocratic principles in particular are less supportive of redistribution, while the opposite has been found for individuals emphasizing the role of structural factors for success. How these beliefs are formed and how individuals come to adopt beliefs either in support of or in contradiction to dominant notions of meritocracy remains a point of contention. Findings vary, especially regarding the relevance of the social positions of individuals—providing diverging and, in some cases, contradictory results. This paper argues for a novel intersectional approach to the study of inequality beliefs to make sense of such scattered findings. People located at different intersections have different experiences, which in turn likely shape their beliefs. As past work has only assessed the influence of these positions as additive variables, the role of intersectionality in belief formation remains unclear. This paper seeks to address this gap by analyzing high-quality survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (N = 17,701) using the MAIHDA approach (Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy) to assess whether and how intersectionality relates to inequality beliefs. Germany provides a particularly interesting case, as beliefs pertaining to work-centered meritocracy are prevalent. Our findings suggest a small but notable effect of intersectional belonging on inequality beliefs, indicating the importance of incorporating an intersectionality perspective into future work within the field.","Samenvatting: Local governments increasingly experiment with citizen participation to engage citizens in decision-making, yet these initiatives often fail to attract citizens equally (Elstub & Escobar, 2019; Tonkens & Verhoeven, 2019). In particular, less-educated citizens remain underrepresented, which exacerbates existing social inequalities. While previous research has largely attributed individual constraints and practical considerations to why this group refrains from engaging, less attention has been given to the participatory process itself – especially the role of emotions therein (e.g. Dekker and Uslaner, 2001). This study investigates how stratified emotional repertoires and bureaucratic norms surrounding emotions shape participatory processes. Existing research suggests that, due to shared emotional repertoires, civil servants – primarily higher educated individuals themselves – may favor the communicative styles of more-educated citizens (Young, 2000; Barnes, 2008). This means that participatory settings tend to privilege dispassionate and detached speech over overtly expressing emotions. Such ‘feeling rules’ (Hochschild, 1983) may alienate less-educated citizens, discouraging both their presence and active participation. Simultaneously, civil servants might engage in emotional labor to regulate and shape citizens’ emotions, potentially reinforcing dominant participatory norms (Hochschild, 1983). \r\nUsing a mixed-methods approach, this research first applies qualitative methods – including interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observations – to explore the lived experiences of both citizens and civil servants. In the second phase, surveys and survey-experiments will assess the broader implications of emotional norms for social inequalities in participation. Eventually, this study aims to contribute to the development of more inclusive participatory processes that accommodate diverse emotional repertoires, ultimately fostering more equitable democratic engagement.","Samenvatting: In this presentation, I merge insights from the domains of political sociology and critical media studies to explore how the rise of digital information communication technologies (DICTs) has impacted the mobilization of collective sentiments of trust in contemporary social movements. Focusing on the dual dynamics of trust and mistrust, my discussion consider the positive and negative characteristics of digitization for ‘progressive’ justice-oriented social movements as well as reactionary illiberal counter-movements. Through an examination of multiple cases from diverse democratic societies, my discussion follows two pathways. First, I consider how the global rise of DICTs has altered the macro-structural landscape of mobilization for social movements, focusing on enabling dynamics of opportunity and empowerment as well as negative dynamics of repression and control. Second, I focus on questions of agency to consider how DICTs are mobilized as strategic tools by social movement actors, paying special attention to alternative movement-based media. In this context, I discuss how DICTs allow civil society actors to develop innovative tactical repertoires focused on practices of civic vigilance, resistance and democratization. By way of conclusion, some suggestions are given for building an impactful research agenda that explores the grassroots politics of trust in the digital age.","Samenvatting: A key goal of groups staging protest is to kickstart political debate. In this paper, we theorize and study how and to what extent protest succeeds in doing so by means of the concept of ‘politicization’. We leverage this concept in two ways. First, we consider politicization as an outcome of protest. Specifically, we map and explain the salience, actor scope and polarization of political elites’ reactions on social media in relation to specific street protest events. Second, we consider politicization as a mechanism. That is, we scrutinize how politicization on social media mediates the impact of protest on the traditional media agenda. We do so by a quantitative analysis of protest (N = 124 events), mass (N = 32.443 news items) and social media data (N = 142.596 tweets) between 2017 and 2019 in Belgium. Our results show that the turnout of a demonstration and the heterogeneity of the mobilized crowd explain variation in politicization on social media, while controlling for particularly potent traditional media and issue controls. Subsequent analyses highlight how social media politicization among politicians mediates the effect of protest on the traditional media agenda. Together, these findings uncover the dynamics of political contestation driven by grassroots mobilization in an era of hybrid media.","Samenvatting: Social media platforms like Instagram have become key sources of political news, with influencers, activists, and civil society actors using them to share information. This study examines Instagram as a space for information activism, where citizen-led political mobilization occurs through the aggregation and distribution of political content. While previous research has explored cross-media consumption and the effects of news-sharing, this paper focuses on persuasive strategies employed by two prominent US-based Instagram accounts, one progressive and one conservative. Using a content analysis of 50 posts per account (289 images), we compare the multimodal rhetorical strategies used to engage followers and promote action. Preliminary findings suggest both types of activism rely on argumentation, sourcing, and brandification to establish credibility. Key differences emerge in four areas: (1) Source selection, progressive accounts use legacy media, while conservatives incorporate alternative media and social media posts; (2) Reasoning—progressives use facts and statistics, while conservatives often employ ambiguity and conspiratorial narratives; (3) Core values, progressives highlight inclusivity and social justice, while conservatives appeal to freedom, tradition, and national pride; (4) Mobilization tactics, progressives focus on political participation (e.g., contacting officials, voting), while conservatives promote alarmism. These strategies reflect the broader ways in which Instagram is used to shape political narratives and mobilize audiences.","Samenvatting: This study examines the differences in trust in political institutions between migrants and natives in Western Europe, focusing on the roles of religiosity and perceived discrimination. Using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) across 15 Western European countries, the analysis reveals that second-generation migrants exhibit significantly lower political trust than both first-generation migrants and natives. Notably, being of Muslim denomination is linked to reduced political trust, highlighting the varying impact of religious integration on political attitudes within a European context that often marginalizes Muslim communities. Perceived discrimination is another key factor that explains the observed differences in political trust. Second-generation migrants report lower trust due to heightened perceptions of societal discrimination. This suggests that perceived discrimination is crucial in shaping political attitudes, particularly among those who have been born and raised in the host society. Overall, these findings emphasize the complex relationship between religiosity, discrimination, and political trust, offering important implications for understanding the integration and political engagement of migrant populations in Western Europe. This study contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it shifts the focus from explaining patterns of exclusion and discrimination toward immigrants to its effects on their political attitudes. Second, whereas existing literature often relied on single-country designs or pooled survey data, this study provides a cross-national perspective on the relationship between migration background and political trust.","Samenvatting: Trust in news media is a critical component of informed citizenship in democratic societies. Individuals have a wide range of options for news consumption, including legacy media, social media, and online news aggregators. However, young adults employ different strategies to evaluate information, and they are also expressing lower trust in the news. Despite some interview studies (e.g. Cotter & Thorson, 2022), more systematic evidence of how people of different ages place trust in various media types and information sources is so far lacking. \r\nThis paper examines to what extent we can find more systematic evidence for the emergence of new media trust repertoires from a cross-national perspective. We use the Media & News Eurobarometer Survey 2023 and employ multilevel Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to inductively find which media trust repertoires can currently be observed in the European Union (N=25,938). The results show four different latent clusters that characterize media trust repertoires in the EU: (a) TV/radio-oriented, (b) public broadcasters + press, (c) online/peer-oriented, (d) non-digitals. Countries cluster in three different latent classes. \r\nIn none of the four trust clusters digital media have fully replaced more traditional media, but for more than 90% of the individuals online media are important in the news consumption. While age is a strong predictor of repertoire membership (as expected), also educational level and type of news consumption have additional predictive value. In countries with higher GDP and more press freedom relatively more people belong to the public broadcaster and press cluster.\r\n\r\n","Samenvatting: High support for freedom of speech is crucial for a democratic society. Most research suggests that the principle of freedom of speech is widely endorsed. However, freedom of speech is neither absolute nor unlimited and may conflict with other democratic rights and values. This raises the question of to what extent and how people learn to navigate and balance the dilemmas around free speech.\r\nThis study focuses on the ‘formative years’ that arguably shape democratic citizenship, employing Dutch panel data among adolescents aged 12 to 16. We analyze four aspects in forming (conditional) support for free speech. First, we study the structure of these attitudes to assess to what extent they become more structured as adolescents age. Second, we study the levels of support to assess how adolescents position themselves. Third, we test the dynamics of social identity theory, which implies that support for free speech wavers if it conflicts with one’s in-group. Fourth, we test to what extent socialization agencies (parents, peers, and teachers) contribute to the formation of attitudes toward freedom of speech. \r\nOur results show high and growing support for freedom of speech. We find that attitudes are structured by support for vertical free speech (related to state-citizen relationships) and horizontal free speech (related to citizen-citizen interactions). Unlike the former, the latter shows variation across time and social groups. Some identities lose influence on support for horizontal free speech, whereas others become more important. Moreover, we find evidence that teacher interactions affect support for free speech.","Samenvatting: Around the world, many people express strong support for democracy and consider it the most desirable form of government. However, research suggests that people think differently about what democracy actually entails. For instance, people in Vietnam, a country rated as non-democracy by the Freedom House Index, consider their country democratic. This raises the question of what people mean when they think of democracy. What are they actually supporting and is there a difference in their understanding of what democracy entails? Previous research show that notions of democracy is a multi-dimensional concept. Given this, most studies have used an item-base approach. However, this approach assumes observed variables are continuous, and overlooks the existence of distinct subgroups with diverse perceptions. There is an alternative person-based approach, which groups individuals based on similar perceptions. Some studies provide an insight regarding notions of democracy by grouping individuals with similar perceptions. However, these studies predominantly focus on democratic countries. As a result, little is known about how individuals in non-democratic countries combine different dimension into one encompassing notion of democracy. Secondly, previous studies did not systematically investigate determinants of notions of democracy, it is largely unknown which macro- and micro-level factors influence conceptions of democracy. Analyzing a data from World Value Surveys Wave 7, we use Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to study notions of democracy in democratic and non-democratic countries. Additionally, we conduct a theory-driven study based on political learning theory, modernization theory, and redistributive theories to examine how individuals' notions of democracy are shaped.","Samenvatting: Although the literature is mixed on the question to what extent attitudinal polarization is increasing in Western societies, scholars agree that polarization is very prevalent in people’s minds. However, systematic explorations of why some individuals perceive more polarization than others remain relatively scarce, with limited focus on the role of the media and the generalization of people’s own attitudes only.\r\nWe propose that people base their perceptions of political polarization, in part, on the perceived attitudinal extremity within their social network, as they may project the extremity of attitudes of their social network onto the extremity of attitudes in society at large. Although extensive research has established the critical role of social networks in shaping attitudes and perceptions, this study is the first to consider the role of social networks to explain perceptions of polarization.\r\nIn a pre-registered study among 879 Dutch participants, we found that having at least one strong tie (i.e., a close contact) with extremely conservative immigration attitudes was strongly associated with perceiving more political polarization while having at least one extremely progressive strong tie was not. Similarly, the number of weak ties (e.g., acquaintances, neighbours) with extremely conservative attitudes also related to perceiving more polarization. Strong anti-immigration attitudes might be readily available when individuals construct perceptions of polarization, as they might be voiced more assertively or provocatively. Our results imply that perceptions of strong polarization might be reduced by having more dialogue, both with moderate and extreme social ties.","Samenvatting: Following the media, a variety of groups feel unheard in current society. The feeling is associated with larger societal issues such as polarisation, declining institutional trust, and populism. Simultaneously, media structures and conventions may limit who or what is heard. What it means to feel unheard collectively, however, remains unclear. To better understand how feeling (un)heard is given meaning in society, this study explores how the concept is socially constructed within Dutch news articles and its development between 1990 and 2023.\r\nWe conducted a quantitative, longitudinal content analysis of five of the largest Dutch newspapers. We explored which groups feel (un)heard, by whom, regarding which topics, what it means, whose voice states they are (un)heard, and whether feeling (un)heard is framed as an explanation or solution to societal issues. Relevant articles were selected from Nexis Uni, resulting in a corpus of 17,248 articles. A codebook was inductively developed to code a random stratified sample of 395 articles manually.\r\nThe analysis provided preliminary insights into different elements of feeling heard, ranging from having a voice, to equal treatment, to the implementation of policies. The findings also show that unheard groups are in a dependent relationship with whom they want to be heard by. Whereas this apparent dependency might suggest otherwise, the reported unheard groups are not solely traditionally disadvantaged but often include middle-class or elite groups. This suggests that feeling unheard is a broader societal experience. Although, privileged groups may be more visible to journalists, leaving other unheard groups, unheard in news media. \r\n","Samenvatting: Steden omarmen in toenemende mate digitale technologieën om als \"slimme\" en datagestuurde organisaties stedelijk bestuur en dienstverlening efficiënter en effectiever te organiseren. De inzet van instrumenten zoals slimme camera’s, geluidssensoren, openbare wifi, deelmobiliteit en digital twins belooft bij te dragen aan een hogere levenskwaliteit door verbeterde veiligheid, efficiëntie en leefbaarheid. Tegelijkertijd hebben deze technologieën een aanzienlijke maatschappelijke impact, omdat ze fundamentele waarden raken, zoals autonomie, privacy, transparantie, inclusiviteit en empowerment. Bovendien wordt hun effectiviteit regelmatig ter discussie gesteld. Ondanks de dominantie van het smart city-discours binnen diverse disciplines, bestuursmodellen en beleidsorganen, zijn de conceptuele fundamenten ervan zelden gebaseerd op democratische politieke constellaties of worden ze als apolitiek beschouwd. Dit discours wordt versterkt door de technocratische en solutionistische benadering die veel steden hanteren, wat het debat dreigt te depolitiseren. Dit onderzoek richt zich op de manier waarop klassieke vormen van lokale representatie zich positioneren binnen technologiegedreven beleidsvorming en -uitvoering en in hoeverre zij een tegenwicht kunnen bieden. Op basis van documentanalyse, observaties en interviews wordt de politieke dynamiek van smart city-beleid in Rotterdam onderzocht, met een focus op hoe gemeenteraadsleden hun kaderstellende, controlerende en vertegenwoordigende rol invullen binnen smart city-dossiers en welke impact zij daarmee hebben op het lokale beleid. De bevindingen dragen bij aan een beter begrip van de democratische verankering van digitalisering in lokale politiek en beogen een toolkit te ontwikkelen met concrete handvatten voor het versterken van politieke zeggenschap in de 'smart city'.","Samenvatting: This article delves into the power dynamics of truth claim legitimation and contestation amid the Covid-19 pandemic, focusing on debates surrounding anti-Covid-19 measures in the digital public sphere. The surge in alternative knowledge challenging mainstream science's authority is a key aspect of post-truth discussions. Official knowledge, encompassing science, politics, and mass media, faces skepticism as people turn to alternative forms of information. In turn, mainstream post truth scholars tend to defend the boundaries of science by debunking alternative knowledge claims. Rather than aligning with mainstream post truth perspectives, this study adopts a symmetrical stance, exploring how truth claims are legitimized and contested in the digital public sphere. Utilizing Steve Fuller's knowledge power games model, we examine truth wars between established experts and adversarial actors. Through thematic content analysis of the Dutch Corona “Truth Wars”, we identify three truth-claimer types, each employing overlapping and distinct truth claim legitimation strategies. This nuanced approach challenges the dichotomy between rational thinkers and affect-based populists, offering a more diverse and complex view of the discursive landscape. The findings contribute to fostering inclusive and informed public discourse amid heightened social polarization and political instability in many countries.","Samenvatting: Parlementair vertoog over immigratie weerspiegelt niet simpelweg hoe volksvertegenwoordigers de statistische realiteiten van migranteninstroom en vreemdelingenpopulatie waarnemen. Elke taaluiting van parlementariërs is een berekende tussenkomst in een politiek landschap, gestuurd door geanticipeerde reacties van tegenspelers en medestanders in de discussie. Met andere woorden, ook veranderingen in dat politieke landschap hebben mogelijk een invloed op hoe over immigratie gesproken wordt. In het veldvocabularium van Bourdieu en Snow: positie-innames in het discursieve veld rond immigratie worden mogelijks gebroken door de logica van het politieke veld.\r\nDe opkomst en toetreding tot de Belgische Kamer van anti-immigratiepartij Vlaams Blok biedt een bijzondere opportuniteit om zo’n breuk te onderzoeken in het Belgisch parlementair vertoog over immigratie. Om dat te onderzoeken, wordt 80 jaar aan parlementaire handelingen geanalyseerd. Met een thesaurus die de dimensies migranteninstroom en vreemdelingenpopulatie dekt, worden fragmenten over immigratie geïsoleerd uit de parlementaire discussies. Een tekstnetwerkanalyse van de geïsoleerde fragmenten toont verschillen in het woordgebruik van parlementariërs in hun tussenkomsten over immigratie. Aan de hand van deze techniek brengen we per legislatuur in kaart hoe het immigratievertoog van verschillende partijen zich tot elkaar verhoudt.\r\nWe verwachten dat het aantal tussenkomsten over immigratie in recente jaren hoger ligt dan aan het begin van de analyseperiode. Meer bepaald vanaf de jaren ‘90 verwachten we een plotse toename, corresponderend met de opkomst van het Vlaams Blok. Daarnaast onderzoeken we hoe andere politieke partijen reageren op het discours van het Vlaams Blok (later Vlaams Belang) door de tekstnetwerken van verschillende legislaturen met elkaar te vergelijken.","Samenvatting: Over het algemeen leidt werkloosheid of baanverlies tot afnemend welzijn, maar de roltheorie en latente deprivatietheorie voorspellen dat andere productieve activiteiten de verloren latente voordelen van betaald werk kunnen compenseren. In een ‘mega-analyse’ van zes longitudinale studies met 500.000+ observaties van meer dan 100.000 respondenten in 20 Europese landen onderzoeken we hoe werkloosheid samenhangt met levenstevredenheid in verschillende leeftijdsgroepen, en of deze relaties anders zijn voor vrijwilligers dan voor niet-vrijwilligers. Resultaten van first-difference modellen laten zien dat werkloosheid negatief samenhangt met levenstevredenheid, en dat mensen van 35-55 jaar het meest te lijden hebben onder gedwongen werkloosheid. De effecten van werkeloosheid zijn niet verschillend voor vrijwilligers en niet-vrijwilligers, wat suggereert dat vrijwilligerswerk geen buffer vormt tegen de stress van werkloosheid. In de gangbare sociologische theorie lijkt de overtuiging te bestaan dat betaald werk en vrijwilligerswerk tot op zekere hoogte uitwisselbare latente sociale functies hebben, maar onze robuuste resultaten leveren geen bewijs voor dit idee. De resultaten wijzen op een sterke sociale norm in Westerse samenlevingen rond betaald werk als de productieve activiteit die iemands identiteit vormt.","Samenvatting: Professional identity (PI) is important in relation to work. Yet, increasing complexity of careers challenge the development of PI. This is even more the case for disciplines such as sociology, where there is a diffuse connection between discipline and professional field. In this study we analyze how this is experienced by sociology graduates working outside academia, using qualitative interviews. Since the programs did not prepare for a specific occupation, the focus in education was mostly on academic formation, while the PI formation only really started after graduation. Many of the interviewees used their job search to find out how to best align their personal motivations, which typically involved a commitment to solving societal issues, with professional work. Often their exploration involved a first ‘in-between job’. Next to these values, interviewees also indicated that they distinguished themselves from colleagues in a critical and practical-analytical ‘way of thinking’ regarding problems and interventions. Hence, while interviewees rarely called themselves sociologist, there appeared to be a latent sociological dimension to their PI. An additional finding was the fact that the interviewees showed a shifting appreciation of the diffuseness: often this was exactly what attracted them to sociology in the first place, yet when entering the labor market many were uncertain about possible occupations. After some years though, they again valued the fact that they could easily shift between occupations. The insights provided by this study help sociology programs to better facilitate the process of PI formation of their students, while these also hold relevance for the broader literature on PI.","Samenvatting: The formal childcare sector is experiencing major staff shortages, putting pressure on the quality provided within the childcare centre and consequently on the children. One cause of the staff shortage is the insufficient supply of new childcare professionals. This study examines pre-service childcare professionals’ intentions to enter the field in relation to the following three aspects: study choice motivation, practicum-based experiences and perceptions regarding the working conditions. Data were collected from students (n=177) enrolled in a 7th-year secondary vocational education program in Flanders (Belgium). Results indicate that only a minority of pre-service childcare professionals intend to enter the profession. Logistic regression analyses reveal that those who perceive that they have good career opportunities (i.e. advancement to staff leadership) are more likely to enter the profession, as do those who showed a high degree of appreciation for the work during their practicum. However, study choice motivation did not affect their intentions to enter the profession, as motivation was uniformly high across all pre-service childcare professionals. These results suggest that only a minority of the pre-service childcare professionals are likely to enter the profession. Those who do may advance to staff leaders within the childcare centre and subsequently leave the profession, exacerbating workforce shortages.","Samenvatting: In alle sociale verbanden praten mensen met elkaar over elkaar, juist ook professionals, collega’s en leidinggevenden. Dit onder elkaar praten over iemand die er niet bij is, wordt soms roddelen genoemd. In deze bijdrage wordt roddelen gezien als  een specifieke vorm van communiceren/interacteren waar minimaal drie personen een sociaal verband met elkaar vormen: een roddeltriade. Deze roddeltriade bestaat uit verteller, luisteraar en de beroddelde persoon; met daarnaast nog vaak omstanders, al dan niet aanwezig. \r\nBij roddelen is sprake van in- en buitensluiten van anderen, en van een verhaal met een zekere nieuwswaarde voor de betrokkenen. Deze nieuwswaarde geldt voor minimaal één betrokkene in de triade en wordt besproken in vertrouwen. Het besprokene omvat  een (morele of ethische) evaluatie van bepaald gedrag of interactie, als kwestie die in die relatie of situatie meer of minder taboe is.\r\nHet aangeraakte taboe in deze relatie of dit sociaal verband kan of mag niet besproken worden, waarmee het vertrouwelijke karakter en de afwezigheid van de beroddelde essentieel lijkt. In de paper wordt gezocht naar een methode om de verschillende vormen van roddelen te exploreren en interventies mogelijk te maken; met als doel mogelijk destructieve gevolgen van roddelen in kleine sociale verbanden te beperken. Het streven is het ontwikkelen van een interventiemethodiek voor leidinggevenden, en professionals die inzetbaar is in de sociale sector, onderwijs en gezondheidszorg.\r\n","Samenvatting: This paper aims to examine how the South Korean labour market is segmented based on workers’ employment trajectory patterns. Over the decades, labour market segmentation literature has shed light on explaining labour market inequality through non-competing segments that advantages certain workers over the others, namely, insiders over outsiders. Nevertheless, despite post-industrialised societies demonstrating increasingly diversifying employment trajectories, little is known as to how the labour market is segmented when taking into account the potential job mobility over time. Against this background, this paper investigates the labour market segmentation patterns taking into account employment trajectories using group-based multi-trajectory modelling on Korean Labor & Income Panel Study data. We find a clear evidence of a segmented labour market, where outsiders have distinct employment trajectories from insiders, and women’s overrepresentation in outsiders. Furthermore, outsiders are trapped in ‘outsider orbit’, indicating a structural barrier that limits women to outsider jobs in Korea.","Samenvatting: Firms’ human resource (HR) policies are key determinants of employment quality. A shift from organizational-oriented (OO) to market-oriented (MO) policies has been observed, with OO firms emphasizing long-term stability through standardized wages and permanent contracts, while MO firms focus on flexibility with performance-based pay and non-standard employment (NSE) contracts. While this flexibility benefits employers, it often results in greater job and income instability for employees, particularly in firms with a high share of low-paid or temporary workers.\r\nDespite prior research highlighting variations in firms’ remuneration and contract policies, their impact on employees' experienced job quality remains unclear. To address this gap, we cluster 1,325 large Dutch firms (500+ employees) based on their contract and remuneration policies, using data from the 2018 Dutch Structure of Earnings Survey (SES) and the Social Statistical Database (SSB). We identify seven distinct clusters: some with OO characteristics, others with MO traits, and some combining elements of both. We then link these clusters to the 2018 National Working Conditions Survey (NEA), analysing the job satisfaction and perceived working conditions of 23,513 employees. This allows us to examine how these employer clusters influence employees' experienced job quality.\r\n","Samenvatting: The Netherlands is known for its high share of employees in fixed-term contracts (FTCs), partly because employers face few restrictions when using FTCs. However, trade unions and employers are allowed to deviate from national legislation in collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) regarding the use of these contracts. The aim of this study is to explore how such agreements in CBAs affect careers of employees with an FTC. \r\nWe use a unique dataset on Dutch CBAs which was linked to Dutch register data. This allowed us to (1) identify employees that were covered by a CBA and which ones were not; and (2) which agreements were made in these CBAs about the use of FTCs. We used hidden Markov models to (1) identify different states of employment quality based on individuals contract type and income; (2) analyze how individuals move between these states; and (3) study how CBAs affect these movements. \r\nWe identified eight states of employment quality, three of which were characterized by having an FTC (differentiated by wage level), and two of which were characterized by having a permanent contract (one with low wages and one with high wages). Being covered by a CBA increased the likelihood of transitioning to a permanent contract for those in the low and middle income groups. In addition, individuals covered by a CBA that deviated from national legislation on the use of FTCs were much less likely to transition to a permanent contract than individuals covered by a CBA that followed national legislation.","Samenvatting: In OECD countries, there has been an increasing interest in self-employment in later life, with policy makers particularly interested in those moving into solo self-employment. This is because this form of work is seen as offering flexibility and autonomy to older workers as they extend their working lives. The UK Department for Work and Pensions (2024), for example, stated that “Self-employment is a popular option for many older workers who want to build on past experience, develop specialist knowledge and increase control over their working lives.” This paper makes a contribution to the literature by developing a model for understanding how, and why, people end up moving into solo self-employment after age 50. This is based on 20 in-depth UK life course interviews lasting around 90 minutes each, from a sample that has been carefully constructed to capture the diversity of solo self-employment. Using a life-course approach (Elder 2004), we find that for most individuals ‘turning points’ related to work, household or health circumstances were important in terms of generating a need, or desire, for work with greater autonomy. At the same time, the principles of ‘linked lives’ and ‘life stage’ generated the opportunity structure that allow individuals to become self-employed. This implies that government attempts to promote self-employment as a means of extending working lives are not likely to succeed unless individuals have such opportunity structures, and much greater focus is therefore needed on making work as an employee more hospitable to older workers.","Samenvatting: Dominant narratives often describe solo self-employment as either a voluntary embrace of entrepreneurialism, or a labour market necessity. This article moves beyond this dichotomy by situating solo self-employment within key contradictions marking contemporary work: the tension between rising expectations for self-expression and autonomy in work, and the increasing precarization that makes these aspirations harder to achieve.\r\nFocusing on architecture and design in the creative industries in the Netherlands and the UK — sectors marked by high expectations for meaningful work alongside precarious conditions — the research employs a mixed-methods design, combining a vignette survey (n=180, vignette N=1080) with in-depth interviews. It explores workers' preferences for solo self-employment and how these are shaped by their working context.\r\nThe vignette survey results show that creative autonomy and self-expression, alongside pay and benefits, are highly valued, while employment type (self-employment or wage employment) by itself is not significant. Interviews offer potential explanations for these findings, revealing that many creative workers pursue self-employment to \"take back control\" — seeking better income, work-life balance, and creative freedom. In other cases, however, self-employment introduces new barriers, with financial risks forcing compromises between material security and self-expression.\r\nThis article argues that self-employment functions less as an ideological embrace of entrepreneurship and more as a strategy for balancing the oft-contradictory expectations from work. Yet, the success of this strategy remains shaped by workers’ starting resources. Ultimately, while self-employment emerges as a response to contradictions in creative work, it risks reproducing the very inequalities that it seeks to overcome.","Samenvatting: As retirement ages increase, reducing working hours before retirement is seen as a way to facilitate longer working lives of those workers struggling with work demands. The current study analyzes individual, household, job, and organizational factors that shape the decision to reduce work hours before retirement. Three key questions are examined: Who plans to reduce working hours before retirement, who is actually reducing working hours, and what explains the discrepancy between the two? Using two waves of the NIDI pension panel survey, we examine the plans to reduce work hours of 2,227 full-time employees aged 60-63 nested in 799  organizations, and track their actual behavior after retirement. Results suggest that 23% of the sample plans to reduce working hours in the years before retirement age. Older workers with poor health and high job pressure were more likely to plan to reduce working hours. In the follow-up years 30% of the older workers actually reduced working hours. Plans proved to be strong predictors of actual behavior. Within those who plan to reduce working hours before retirement, around half actually reduces them; around 30% of those who were uncertain ends up reducing work hours; and a fifth of those who planned to work full-time until retirement eventually reduces work hours. Findings from this study contribute to scientific debates about agency during later working lives and to policy debates about gradual retirement pathways.","Samenvatting: Collective bargaining is often considered a wage-regulating institution, yet empirical evidence on the relation between collectively bargained pay rates and earned wages is scarce. Traditional theorizing in industrial relations suggests that the determination of wages is a core motivation for both employers and trade unions to engage in bargaining. The decentralization thesis argues that employers, seeking to maximize discretion over pay, may be loath to negotiate binding provisions on wages. In this study, we introduce the concept of the earned-bargained wage gap to explore the relation between bargained pay rates and earned wages across seven European countries. We ask to what extent the earned-bargained wage gap differs between sectors and countries, and whether it is moderated by gender and occupational class. Matching pay rates from 83 collective agreements from 7 countries to a sample of 838.609 matched observations in the European Structure of earnings survey, we pilot three strategies for estimating the earned-bargained wage gap. We find substantial differences between countries in the extent to which bargained pay rates exceeded or fell short of median earned wages, as well as in the extent to which collectively bargained pay scales covered the full distribution of earned wages, or only the top or bottom deciles. Furthermore, matching occupation-coded bargained pay rates in Dutch collective agreements to individual respondents’ earned wages, our study showed that groups of workers known to earn relatively higher wages in the labor market also earned larger ‘wage cushions’, i.e. wages in excess of bargained pay rates.","Samenvatting: Precarious jobs – characterized by insecurity or unsafe conditions, are precarious in terms of the continuity and quantity of work, limited opportunities for advancement, and pose significant challenges to workers’ well-being. Precarity can manifest in work (i.e., related to the continuity and stability of work), at work (i.e., unsafe or exploitative conditions), or from work (i.e., jobs failing to meet basic financial or personal needs). While the impact of precarious work is often examined at the workplace, its effects extend beyond, influencing individuals as they move across multiple aspects of daily life. \r\nTo explore these dynamics, we conducted a working-along study with individuals in Rotterdam holding precarious jobs (n=12). We recorded all interactions, focusing on the origins and nature of their work, job content, decision-making processes, job continuity, and perceived support. We thematically coded all references of precarity in, at, and from work, analyzed participants’ considerations regarding (future) trade-offs and job sustainability, and synthesized our findings to conceptualize precarity as a social phenomenon. \r\n\tOur preliminary findings suggest that precarity on the job not always translates into broader life, especially for older workers. However, when individuals experience precarity from work (i.e., financial strain, (unpaid) overtime, or irregular hours) social support from colleagues and friends becomes crucial. These networks were often essential for survival rather than for fostering personal growth and well-being. This underscores the dual role of social connections in precarious work: they serve as a safety net but may also limit opportunities for long-term stability and advancement.\r\n","Samenvatting: Despite policy advancements aimed at promoting gender equality in caregiving responsibilities, paternity leave uptake and the reduction of work hours among male employees remains limited. Drawing on Dutch administrative register data encompassing all male employees in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from 2010 onward, this study examines the influence of male managerial role modeling on male employees' parental leave and work hours reduction decisions. While previous research has qualitatively explored workplace cultures and peer effects as critical determinants of leave-taking behavior, empirical evidence from large-scale, generalizable samples remains scarce. Using multilevel probit models, this study investigates whether male managers who actively take paternity leave or reduce working hours after childbirth serve as influential role models, thereby increasing the likelihood of their male subordinates to do the same. Preliminary analyses reveal considerable variation in parental leave uptake. By leveraging high-quality administrative data, this research circumvents common methodological limitations such as social desirability and selectivity biases associated with surveys. The findings hold substantial implications for organizational practices, suggesting that male leaders actively demonstrating caregiving responsibilities can effectively foster supportive environments and normalize paternity leave uptake among men.","Samenvatting: Building on a large body of studies that use correspondence experiments to show discrimination in hiring on a diverse range of grounds such as ethnicity, race or gender this paper aims to provide analytical clarity on the different micro-level mechanisms that drive discriminatory hiring outcomes. Moving beyond the distinction between taste-based and statistical discrimination, I propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes five micro-level mechanisms: taste-based, variance-based individual-level, mean-based statistical, mean-variance statistical and prototype-based discrimination. I describe and formalise each mechanism, summarize what we already know about their presence and dominance from existing studies, offer a comparison between them, and identify new avenues for research.  In doing so, the paper serves two key objectives. First, I provide analytical detail on the mechanisms that the current literature generally relies on when theoretically describing discriminatory hiring outcomes. Second, I generate a set of testable hypotheses which can be used in future studies. The results of this theoretical exercise show that the mechanisms of taste-based, variance-based individual-level, mean-based statistical, mean-variance statistical and prototype-based discrimination provide distinct explanations. Yet, while some evidence supports taste-based discrimination, empirical support for other mechanisms remains limited. I identify the need to systematically study the proposed mechanisms in comparison to taste-based discrimination using laboratory experiments, factorial survey experiments, and observational designs. This will help assess their relative explanatory power across different hiring contexts and clarify their role in driving discriminatory hiring outcomes.","Samenvatting: Research on labor market inequalities frequently identifies discrimination as a contributing factor affecting minority groups such as migrants, women, and sexual minorities, who face significant disadvantages in employment and wages. Although these groups are often studied separately, individuals are characterized by the intersection of their migration background, gender, and sexuality. Currently, there is limited consensus on how the combination of two minority statuses leads to labor market disadvantages, and few studies have examined the simultaneous effects of all three. This study contributes to the literature by analyzing the role of the intersection of migration background, gender, and sexual minority status on the likelihood of employment and wages in the Netherlands. The study uses administrative population data from the Netherlands which include sufficient observations across all groups. Information on gender, country of origin and committed relationships, are used to construct the intersecting minority groups. We expect that migrant women face the greater disadvantages compared to migrant men. However, we also expect that sexual minority status may mitigate the disadvantages associated with gender and migration background. Although sexual minorities challenge traditional gender norms, sexual minorities signal liberal values that contrast and mitigate the more conservative values often associated with migrant women. By examining employment and wages, this research offers a comprehensive understanding of the role the intersection for disadvantages when securing employment and when translating labor into earnings. We expect that the role of intersecting minority statuses may be larger for employment compared to wages.","Samenvatting: The #MeToo movement has heightened media awareness of sexual harassment and, more broadly, social unsafety in the workplace. However, scientific understanding of social unsafety lags behind. While scholars recognize that different dimensions of social unsafety are interrelated, research provides a rather fragmented view because social unsafety behaviors are predominantly examined in isolation. Furthermore, intersectionality is rarely considered, although people likely experience social unsafety differently based on the intersection of their various socio-demographic characteristics. To address these gaps, this study uses large-scale, representative survey data on Dutch employees (NEA, 2022), taking a holistic and intersectional approach to understand patterns in experiences with various dimensions of social unsafety in the workplace and its differences across intersectional groups. Preliminary descriptive findings show that incidences of social unsafety among Dutch employees are remarkably low, especially for transgressive behaviors like bullying, intimidation, unwanted sexual attention, and physical violence. Latent class analyses identified an eight-class solution, for which we now focus on the four classes (altogether, 5.64 percent) showing a relatively high probability of experiencing mentioned transgressive behaviors. All four classes were likely to experience conflicts at work. In contrast, they varied greatly in their experiences with incivility and psychological unsafety. The four classes further diverged in terms of perpetrator power: two classes experienced social unsafety from supervisors, one class from coworkers, and one from both supervisors and coworkers. Next steps are testing how (intersections of) gender, migration background, educational level, and age influence the probability of Dutch employees belonging to the identified social unsafety classes.","Samenvatting: The expansion of higher education has intensified competition among graduates, leading employers to consider additional signals of productivity, such as work experience. While many students enter the labor market with significant work experience, research on its long-term labour market returns remains limited. This study examines how different types of student employment—field-related and non-field-related—affect early career outcomes in the Netherlands, where student employment is widespread. Additionally, we explore whether these effects vary by socio-economic status (SES). Theoretically, we draw on human capital and signalling theories to explain the labour market implications of student employment. Human capital theory suggests that work experience enhances skills and long-term career prospects, whereas signalling theory posits that its effects may be strongest at labour market entry. Using register data from Statistics Netherlands (2011–2020), we analyse a cohort of 86,565 graduates, tracking their student employment history (2011–2013) and post-graduation labour market outcomes (2014–2020). We apply a Hidden Markov Model to construct a latent employment quality variable based on employment status, income, and contract type. This allows us to estimate the probability of entering different employment quality states at labour market entry and the transitions to higher-quality employment over time, comparing outcomes across work experience types and socio-economic groups. By distinguishing between types of student employment and their interaction with SES, this study provides new insights into how work experience shapes early career outcomes and its implications for social inequality.","Samenvatting: Previous research examined gender representations in neofolk content using only qualitative methods focused on women. No quantitative analysis of sexualized objectification for both genders had been attempted. This study employs a mixed-methodology explanatory sequential approach for investigating the sexualized objectification of (wo)men in neofolk lyrics. Firstly, following the methodology of traditional quantitative content analysis, three coders coded lyrics of 296 neofolk songs. Findings revealed a substantial disparity, with women being the primary targets across all initial instances exhibiting elements of sexualized objectification compared to men. Particularly notable are elements of Sexualized movements and Provocative clothing whose targets were solely women. Additionally, results indicated a slight increase in overall sexualized objectification over time. Secondly, responsive semi-structured interviews with two participants were conducted to explore how Croatian young adults experience and integrate neofolk lyrics into their everyday lives and gender performativities. Both participants were in their twenties and self-identified as women. Qualitative data disclosed themes around the usage of neofolk lyrics as a means of fulfilling the neoliberal demand for emotional productivity, as well as duality and selectivity in feminine readings and the integration of neofolk lyrics. Practical implications of media literacy education, limitations, and future inquiry paths are discussed and suggested.  ","Samenvatting: Questions of resistance and activism, and social and political consciousness in Hip Hop culture have been studied within the multidisciplinary Hip Hop scholarship, shaped by the Hip Hop Studies Reader That’s the Joint! published in 2003 by Routledge. Even before this publication, in the 1990s, seminal work of Tricia Rose, Black Noise, called for academia to give its overdue attention to Hip Hop as culture and music genre and industry. The Journal of Hip Hop studies has been published since 2010, and since 2020 the Global Hip Hop Studies Journal. Across these, and many other relevant contributions, the debates about politically conscious, resistant and authentic Hip Hop and implications of such discourses have become a commonplace.  To add to a more nuanced and less romanticized idea of resistance and politically conscious Hip Hop and building on recent scholarship of Justin A. Williams and Griffith J. Rollefson on Hip Hop as postcolonial (counter) narrativity and activism, I have become concerned with exploring the multitude of resistance avenues in European postcolonial context. The significant lack of focus on emotions and emotional discourses in Hip Hop culture stood out. This paper will elaborate the emotions framework and approach to the study of Hip Hop culture and music, and discuss the benefits, challenges and limitations of applying sentiment analysis (with R) to the rap and Hip Hop songs of Dutch rappers. The discussion will also include some preliminary findings based on a limited data sample. ","Samenvatting: Many Dutch youngsters are dissatisfied with their own financial situation. They feel limited to do things that they consider important in life and experience stress because they feel ‘stuck’ in their current situation. Almost half of the youngsters mention ‘getting rich’ as a life goal. From rags to riches narratives, grinding, and stacking are not uncommon themes in (Dutch) rap music. The lyrics of artists are often about earning money fast and spending it on luxury goods. Rappers are also very keen to radiate success on social media. Youngsters use rap music to reflect on themselves and the world around them, even though the scripts provided in rap music are not always as reliable or authentic as they seem. Therefore, this study focuses on the following research question: how do listeners of Dutch rap view messages about money, status and luxury goods? By means of music and photo elicitation in a focus group setting we investigated how participants respond to these kinds of messages, how they negotiate this meaning together, and which contextual factors influence this process. ","Samenvatting: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) in music creation and production may significantly disrupt human creativity within the music industry. While existing research has mainly concentrated on AI’s impact on copyright issues or recommendation algorithms, the perspectives and strategies of musicians themselves in relation to this development have largely been overlooked. These perspectives are crucial because they can shape the trajectory of technological disruptions; determining which tools gain adoption and how they are integrated into creative processes of musicians. Furthermore, this research gap is also of academic importance as if forces us to rethink the meaning and definition of both creativity and labour in music creation and production.  \r\nThis qualitative study seeks to bridge this research gap by exploring the relationship between musicians and generative AI. It focuses on musicians' attitudes towards AI and the ways they engage with these technologies in their professional practices. Special attention is given to how AI influences labor dynamics within the music industry, from production to distribution, and how musicians perceive their role in the creative process in light of these tools. The research is based on 15 semi-structured interviews with musicians (based in Europe) at various career stages. Through this inductive, exploratory approach, the study aims to offer a nuanced understanding of the intersection between music, creativity, technology, and labour.","Samenvatting: This article proposes a theoretical framework for understanding how musicians justify their use of digital platforms, despite expressing criticisms. It draws upon Boltanski and Thévenot's sociology of justification, arguing that musicians navigate multiple, often conflicting, \"orders of worth\" when making decisions about platform engagement. Social media is used as a case study to illustrate how musicians negotiate \"tests,\" \"critiques,\" and \"compromises\" between these competing values. The framework aims to move beyond standard critiques of platformization by foregrounding musicians' own critical engagement with platforms. This is done by highlighting the ways they justify their uses of specific platforms as well as the ways they support their criticisms on platformization’s implications for their work. Ultimately, it advocates for more nuanced empirical research informed by this theoretical lens.","Samenvatting: Music festival scholars note how these events have increasingly become a part of urban regeneration projects and placemaking in a process referred to as “festivalisation” (Hitters & Mulder, 2020). Recent research has found that over the past 20 years, music festivals have shifted from using large outdoor spaces, to smaller, more intimate indoor spaces (Calkins and Swartjes, forthcoming). While urban spatial inequality is well-researched (Sampson 2012; Wilson 2011) including work on the role of redlining in shaping the retail landscape (Kwate and Loh, 2016), there is very little engagement with spatial inequality in festival research.  In this paper, we therefore explore the extent to which festivalisation happens more in certain urban areas over others. In other words, we question which neighborhoods tend to reap the supposed benefits of festivalisation and which neighborhoods do not. More specifically, we propose a framework to understand how festivalisation is shaped by socio-spatial inequality through the use of Exploratory Spatial Analysis and statistical modelling. Taking a comparative spatio-temporal approach, we study 2.456 festival locations in 389 neighborhoods throughout Rotterdam (NL) and Milwaukee (US) over a nearly half century span of time (1970 – 2018). Statistical modelling results show that the concentration of festival locations is shaped by the interaction of race/ethnicity and income levels, controlling for other neighborhood factors (density, income, % children). We argue that acknowledging the city is a site of difference and contestation will set more realistic expectations about how festivals play a role in the city and for whom.","Samenvatting: Nightclubs are facing increasing pressure due to a variety of economic and urban developments such as gentrification, densification, post-pandemic recovery and inflation. At the same time, as nightclubs weather these challenges and threats, there is a parallel trend of increasing governmental recognition and legitimation of club cultures in urban policy, resulting in nightlife-specific funding schemes, subsidies and increased professionalisation. This paper scrutinises this institutionalisation of nightlife, posing the question to what extent the institutionalisation of club cultures provides a sustainable pathway forward for nightlife scenes. The paper does so by comparing two highly institutionalised nightlife scenes in Western Europe, Amsterdam and Berlin, as both cities often function as policy examples for local governments around the Global North. Based on document-based policy analysis and semi-structured qualitative interviews with 36 nightclub promoters in Amsterdam and 28 nightclub promoters in Berlin, we seek to investigate how they understand and negotiate these political moves towards institutionalisation. First, we explore how nightlife policy can create conditions that foster nocturnal creativity, for example by providing stability and opportunities, in ways that can (temporarily) free promoters from market demands. Second, we discuss the limits of institutionalisation, analysing the problems that arise as night cultures become embedded in institutional politics. Historically, nightworlds have provided space for subversive cultural genres, transgressive politics, marginalised subcultures and ‘rough’ experiences – aspects that may be impacted by institutionalisation.","Samenvatting: The music sector has evolved from a linear value chain based sector to a complex adaptive network, often referred to as the music ecosystem. This ecosystem provides economic, social and cultural value, including the potential to mobilize societal action toward better futures, that include equity and sustainability. However, music ecosystems have faced a plethora of systemic challenges such as inequality, precariousness and lack of diversity - as well as challenges around sustainability and climate. To tackle these, we map, qualify and determine the transformative potential of the so-called “Seeds of Change”.  \r\nSeeds are niche initiatives that have the potential to create transformative change towards a desirable future of the Dutch popular music ecosystem. Therefore, we developed a Transformative Potential Framework, based on three dimensions: 1) creation of a set of desired futures with regards to the systemic challenges 2) the level of the leverage point the Seed targets, and 3) the contribution of the Seed towards the aforementioned desired futures.  \r\nThrough an online survey, we have collected 59 unique Seeds in the Dutch popular music ecosystem which we then categorized into 11 categories, ranging from talent development to technological innovation, and from capacity building to diversity and inclusion initiatives. 21 Seeds target the values & beliefs level of the music ecosystem, have potential multi-level impact, and contribute to the desired futures that were formulated with regards to the systemic issues the Dutch popular music ecosystem is struggling with. The final step is an analysis of appropriate scaling strategies for this set of seeds.","Samenvatting: For many autistic individuals, unmasking—the process of ceasing to camouflage autistic traits—is presented as an essential step toward authenticity and well-being. However, this process is fraught with complexity, as unmasking is often met with social resistance, even in environments that claim to be inclusive. This article explores the paradox of unmasking by examining how queer autistic individuals navigate the tension between the need for authentic self-presentation and the structural and interpersonal barriers that make unmasking difficult or even impossible. Using a critical-constructivist Grounded Theory approach, this study draws on qualitative data from semi-structured diaries and interviews with queer autistic participants to investigate the social conditions under which unmasking is attempted, supported, or suppressed. The findings reveal that while unmasking can lead to empowerment within inclusive spaces, it can also be experienced as exhausting to unlearn these habits or constantly navigate what to mask and what not to. Constrained by the combination of gendered and neurotypical norms, unmasking appeared to be often impossible, while still desirable. Even within self-claimed inclusive spaces or with neurodiverse peers, participants often experience pressures to conform to stereotypical expectations. This study highlights the urgent need for deeper structural change and a redefinition of what true inclusivity entails, moving beyond mere tolerance to genuine acceptance of neurodivergent modes of being.\r\n\r\nDit artikel is geschreven voor de Masterclass van Tijdschrift Sociologie 2025","Samenvatting: Queer electronic dance parties can be characterized as ‘wild’ experiences of fun and pleasure. Throughout their emergence and in contemporary times, they have contributed to the becoming- queer of many. This research project addresses how queer clubbers negotiate queerness at electronic dance parties in contemporary Amsterdam, drawing on interviews with twelve self-identifying queer clubbers. The interviews revealed that 1) queer electronic dance parties in Amsterdam can contribute to queer world-making, as they provided means to belong, experience, and do queerness; 2) experiencing queerness goes beyond sexuality and gender for many, and it is importantly experienced in doing, while sexuality and gender still seem to be at queer’s definitional center when looking at the ‘outness’ it produces; 3) the contingency and fluidity that is ascribed to queer, and enjoyed by many, can be difficult to negotiate in practice, as the club may provide a space for fluidity but also rigidity when an intelligible performance of queerness is needed to enter a party and find belonging. As was said by Butler: ‘if the term ‘Queer’ is to be a site of collective contestation’ it will have to remain ‘never fully owned’ (1993, p.19). A form of ownership over queerness seems to be visible at times in the Amsterdam queer electronic dance scene, where clubbers are deemed queer “enough” based on appearance. Which can result in an atmosphere that is experienced as normative and intimidating, and could contribute to clubbers performing queerness in a stereotypical way, therefore going against the fluidity that queer ascribes.\r\n\r\nDit artikel is geschreven voor de Masterclass van Tijdschrift Sociologie 2025","Samenvatting: Het blijft een heet hangijzer in de muziek: diversiteit op en achter het podium. En programmeurs spelen hierin een cruciale rol. Wanneer programmeurs claimen dat ze niet kijken naar gender, is het resultaat vaak een door mannen gedomineerde line up. \r\nProgrammeurs fungeren als gatekeepers die het culturele aanbod selecteren en zo zowel het economisch voortbestaan van artiesten beïnvloeden als het publieksaanbod vormgeven. Ondanks hun cruciale rol, is hun beslissingsproces vaak ondoorzichtig. Hoewel programmeurs het belang van artistiek-inhoudelijke motieven zullen benadrukken, kunnen meerdere motieven een grote rol spelen en hun keuzes beïnvloed worden door (onder meer) een gender bias. Bovendien zijn gatekeepers’ beslissingen niet louter individueel, maar ingebed in sociale processen, en moeten programmeurs deze legitimeren tegenover diverse actoren. In een dynamische markt waarin continu nieuwe artiesten opkomen, vertrouwen programmeurs vaak op andere gatekeepers om het aanbod te filteren, waarbij informele netwerken en aanbevelingen van peers doorslaggevend kunnen zijn.\r\nOnderdeel van mijn PhD over vrouwelijke professionals in de Nederlandse muziekindustrie, is dit onderzoek naar de boekingsstrategieën en het beslissingsproces van muziekprogrammeurs. Op basis van diepte-interviews met club- en festivalprogrammeurs, exploreer ik hun beroepspraktijk en -ervaringen. Daarbij richt ik mij specifiek op de genderdynamieken binnen hun werkcontext en hoe de programmeurs navigeren in zowel een door mannen gedomineerde industrie, als een door mannen gedomineerde functie. Voortbouwend op een theoretisch kader van sociologische en gendertheorieën over gatekeepers, talent en beslissingsprocessen, en ‘the gendered genius’ ontleed ik hoe programmeurs tot hun keuzes komen.","Samenvatting: In de Westerse samenleving speelt emotie een belangrijke rol in hoe mannelijk mannen geacht worden (Reeser & Gottzén, 2018; Meth, 2009; hooks, 2004). Deze studie gaat de connectie na tussen emotie en mannelijkheid door de rol van gendernormen te onderzoeken in de emotieregulatie van stedelijke en rurale mannen in België. Door stedelijke en rurale mannen te vergelijken, konden verschillen nagegaan worden in de spatiale context. Hiervoor werden diepte-interviews afgenomen met acht stedelijke mannen en acht rurale mannen. Uit de analyse kwam een tweeledige gevoelsregel naar voren die vormgaf aan hun emotieregulatie: ten eerste leest de regel dat (sombere) emoties, met uitzondering van boosheid, een zwakte zijn. Bijgevolg betekent dit dat emotionele expressie op een praktische, bijkomstige manier hoort te gebeuren. Hierbij is de expressie terloops, rationeel en oplossingsgericht. Dit script reflecteert de patriarchale definitie van mannelijkheid als kracht, rationaliteit en zelfredzaamheid (Wasylkiw & Clairo, 2018; Velding, 2015). Sterke verschillen waren hier op te merken op geografisch vlak. Rurale mannen hadden conservatievere overtuigingen en internaliseerden de patriarchale norm meer, terwijl stedelijke mannen progressiever waren en de patriarchale norm meer verwierpen. Dit contrast bekrachtigt de huidige polarisering in de Belgische samenleving. Ondanks contestatie van de patriarchale norm, conformeerden ook de stedelingen echter meestal aan de gevoelsregel. Dit patroon bevestigt een cyclus die moeilijk te doorbreken is omdat een non-patriarchale cultuur voor emotionele openheid onder mannen nog niet opgebouwd en genormaliseerd is.  \r\n\r\nDit artikel is geschreven voor de Masterclass van Tijdschrift Sociologie 2025\r\n","Samenvatting: Mainstream pornography often relies on socio-cultural stereotypes to deliver its viewers sexual gratification. While extensive research has examined porn consumption patterns, motivations, and effects on sexual satisfaction and behavior, little is known about how individuals actively select pornography and categorize its content. Given the dominance of gendered stereotypes in mainstream porn, understanding the classification processes behind this selection is crucial. In this study we used a Q-sort methodology, in which we asked 81 participants at Lowlands Festival 2024, a setting chosen for its open-minded and diverse audience, to rank 32 pornographic video titles based on sexual attractiveness. To navigate the sensitivity and stigma often surrounding the topic of porn, we utilized a private interview setup where the respondents stayed anonymous: the “Pornfessionbooth”. The results from the Q-sort were analyzed using a principal component analysis and interpreted alongside the qualitative interview insights. Our findings show five distinct clusters of respondents: the ‘Equality Petitioners’, the ‘Authenticity Realists’, the ‘Selective Visualists’, the ‘Traditional Role-Upholders’ and the ‘Fantasy Thrill Seekers’. These clusters represent how individuals classify pornographic content based on gendered pleasure, gendered dominance and power, fantasy versus realism and age considerations. These four key frameworks highlight the underlying mechanisms shaping porn selection and interpretation, therefore providing new insights into different porn classification processes.","Samenvatting: Online pornography has expanded into a global cultural industry, reaching hundreds of millions of viewers daily. Despite its magnitude, the genre remains reliant on formulaic narratives that draw on entrenched stereotypes—particularly at the intersection of gender and ethno-racial representation. Existing research has highlighted these patterns through qualitative and quantitative content analyses, yet such approaches face limitations in scope and scalability. This study advances the field by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to a large-scale dataset of over 200 000 Pornhub video entries spanning 10 years (from 2008 to 2018), to investigate how stereotypes are embedded in the platform’s classification systems (tags, categories, and titles). Our findings contribute to both pornography studies and broader sociological debates on algorithmic bias, digital discrimination, and the role of language in encoding social hierarchies. By uncovering the structural mechanisms through which stereotypes persist in online pornography, this study offers a novel methodological and theoretical lens on the intersections of technology, media, and inequality.","Samenvatting: While the effects of pornography on youth have been extensively studied, research has primarily focused on consumption rather than how young people interpret and engage with gendered and racialized narratives. Few studies examine how youth critically negotiate, contest, or internalize these stereotypes. This systematic scoping review synthesizes theoretical and empirical insights into how youth (16–25 years) in OECD countries engage with these stereotypes, highlighting dominant conceptual frameworks and methodological gaps.\r\nFollowing the PRISMA-ScR framework, a systematic search across eight academic databases identified 29 studies with conceptual and empirical contributions relevant to our research questions. Unlike prior reviews, this study takes a multidisciplinary approach to mapping how youth interpret pornographic stereotypes, rather than focusing solely on consumption patterns or media effects. The analysis assesses how studies conceptualize youth engagement with pornographic stereotypes, identifying gaps in youth agency, interdisciplinary integration, and longitudinal perspectives.\r\nThe results of this review inform both academic debates and practical interventions, such as porn literacy programs and digital sexual education.\r\nThis study is part of a PhD project funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and is registered on OSF (Mikkers et al., 2024).","Samenvatting: Mainstream pornography has a long history of relying on stereotypes to deliver sexual gratification to consumers. Despite mounting evidence that overconsumption of pornographic stereotypes relates to a slew of psychological and societal issues, the popularity of online pornography continues to grow, and to remain staunchly stereotypical. Why so many people from diverse social backgrounds enjoy watching (potentially damaging) stereotypes in pornography remains poorly understood. To address this, we conducted a high-powered experimental study in which we measured heart-rate, eye-tracking, and subjective ratings while individuals were exposed to graphic pornography that varied in terms of the gender stereotypes depicted. We found (i) both men and women preferred pornography with no clear power-dynamic (so-called “vanilla” pornography), (ii) the leas preferred category by both males and females was the so-called anti-stereotype, where there’s a dominant woman and a submissive man, (iii) the aversion to this category of pornography was stronger in women than in men, and (iv) strongest for women with more traditional gender values. (v) Physiologically, we find that when the stimuli became graphic, there was a significant slowing of the heart, consistent with the idea that individuals found the content morally threatening, resulting in a freezing response. Again we (vi) find that this heart-rate slowing to be most pronounced in the anti-stereotype condition, (vii) more pronounced in woman than in men, and (viii) most pronounced in women with traditional views of gender-roles. Taken together, our results provide evidence for how social norms literally get under your skin.","Samenvatting: Introduction. Despite greater societal acceptance, sexually and gender diverse (SGD) youth continue to face higher rates of bullying and feel less safe in schools compared to their heterosexual, cisgender peers. These disparities are driven by hetero- and cisnormative norms in schools, but it remains unclear how school policies impact these issues. This study identifies latent classes of school policies in the Netherlands and explores their potential role in moderating disparities in victimization and social unsafety based on sexual orientation and gender modality. \r\nMethods. Cross-sectional data from 142 management employees at 48 Dutch secondary schools were analyzed using Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to identify the structure of 23 school policies. These policies addressed inclusion, SGD-based respect, discrimination prevention, behavioral discipline, performance-based respect, and staff/parent incentives. \r\nResults. LCA revealed five latent policy classes: (1) high on behavioral discipline, low on inclusion; (2) moderate across several dimensions, low on staff/parent incentives; (3) high on inclusion and discrimination prevention, moderate on SGD-based respect; (4) high on inclusion, moderate on staff/parent incentives; and (5) high across all categories except behavioral discipline. Schools with stricter disciplinary policies were generally less inclusive of SGD issues, while those with moderate behavioral discipline were more inclusive. \r\nConclusion. This study highlights variations in school policies and suggests that while inclusion and discrimination prevention may be prioritized, SGD-based respect remains moderate. A follow-up study will investigate how these policy classes influence disparities, informing more effective interventions.","Samenvatting: Ondanks dat in Nederland op nationaal niveau en lokaal niveau wordt geïnvesteerd om LGBTQ+ discriminatie te verminderen en de acceptatie te bevorderen, is de emancipatie nog lang niet voltooid. Zowel LGBTQ+ personen als een aanzienlijk deel van de lokale overheden benadrukken daarbij het belang van lokaal beleid om acceptatie te vergroten. \r\nWetenschappelijk onderzoek naar de effectiviteit van antidiscriminatiebeleid is echter gelimiteerd, op twee manieren. Ten eerste richten eerdere studies zich vooral op nationale beleidskaders of bredere culturele normen. Maar er zijn grote verschillen binnen landen in zowel het bestaande beleid als de ervaren acceptatie van LHBTI+ personen, die zo over het hoofd worden gezien. Ten tweede richt bestaand onderzoek zich voornamelijk op percepties van beleid onder LHBTI+ personen. Hoewel of beleid landt bij de doelgroep evident belangrijk is, is het ook belangrijk om te weten welk beleid er eigenlijk bestaat volgens beleidsmakers. \r\nIn de huidige studie onderzoeken we hoe het lokale antidiscriminatiebeleid zoals gerapporteerd door beleidsmakers en het beleid zoals ervaren door LHBTI+ personen de ervaren acceptatie onder LHBTI+ personen beïnvloedt. Daarbij gebruiken we fijnmazige metingen van het gerapporteerde beleid door beleidsmakers – niet alleen of er antidiscriminatiebeleid is, maar ook welke maatregelen er worden genomen en of er prioriteit aan de LHBTI+ groepen wordt gegeven. Daarnaast is onze studie uniek omdat we gebruikmaken van een steekproef van meer dan 2,000 LHBTI+ respondenten in Nederland, waardoor we ook kunnen onderzoeken of er verschillen zijn tussen bepaalde groepen, bijvoorbeeld tussen non-binaire mensen versus homoseksuele mannen.","Samenvatting: Muslims are generally portrayed as opposing homosexuality; however, recent studies have shown that the relation between Muslims and homosexuality is more complex. In this study, we try to further understand how Islamic religiosity shapes Muslims’ (multilayered) perspectives on sexual orientation (and connectedly sexuality and gender identity) in the Netherlands, while taking an intersectional perspective particularly regarding people’s gender. Applying this approach, the study endeavors to provide a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of how Muslims follow and/or negotiate religious interpretations, discourses and beliefs with regard to homosexuality, and which sources one draws from. Drawing on 35 in-depth interviews with Dutch Muslims in a racialized context, we find that (conflicting) religious interpretations, respect for one`s free choice, and Islamophobia play an important role in Muslims’ perspectives on homosexuality, both in terms of challenging and reconciling societal expectations and religious teachings","Samenvatting: This study investigates how sexual orientation and gender identity and expression (SOGIE) factors and identity disclosure intersect to influence perceptions of professionalism in the workplace. We investigated how social identities influence professional evaluations based on the status-belief theory. Using a factorial vignette design, we manipulated gender (woman, man), sexual orientation (heterosexual, gay/lesbian, bisexual), gender expression (feminine, gender-neutral, masculine), and sexual orientation disclosure (full disclosure, selective disclosure, full concealment) within fictitious employee profiles. A representative sample of 376 UK participants evaluated six randomized profiles on perceived professionalism. The results reveal significant biases against LGB employees, particularly those who fully disclose their sexual orientation. Men with feminine expressions faced harsher penalties, while women experienced more flexibility in expressing non-conforming gender traits. These findings underscore how norms around gender and sexuality shape professional evaluations and perpetuate workplace inequities.","Samenvatting: Sex work was decriminalized in Belgium on June 1, 2022. Since December 1, 2024, a labor framework has allowed sex workers to work as self-employed or salaried employees. Yet sex work is often hidden, concealed and kept secret: few sex workers are completely outed. Their work is often hidden from their loved ones for fear of rejection, break-up or judgment. It is hidden from administrations and institutions to avoid administrative and financial sanctions. It is also hidden from homeowners for fear of being refused accommodation. Sex workers are reluctant to report sexual assaults, violence or scams linked to their activity, for fear of both being deprived of their rights and of having their activity revealed. Many sex workers in Belgium still live in secrecy, compartmentalizing their lives to deal with the stigma they face. Based on these field observations gathered during my two years of research for my doctoral thesis in criminology (ULB), this presentation will question the notions of coming out and secrecy in the professional careers of sex workers. Using sociologist Howard Becker's concept of “deviant careers”, I'll examine how professional careers in sex work are still kept secret, parallel, on the margins of society, and therefore still deviant\".","Samenvatting: The notion of professional identity, as it appears in sociological literature, refers both to the individual's integration of a series of collective dimensions linked to the group to which he or she belongs and to the organisational and institutional framework and the ‘subjective’ interpretation and reinterpretation of these collective dimensions. In this context, ‘the relationship between inherited identities, accepted or rejected by individuals, and targeted identities, in continuity or rupture with previous identities, depends on the modes of recognition by legitimate institutions and their agents in direct contact with subjects’ (Dubar 2022). \r\nOur contribution aims to examine the deployment of the professional identity of a group of sex workers in the context of a transformation of legal norms relating to prostitution and sex work - in this case, in the context of ‘decriminalisation’ in Belgium between 2023 and 2025. We base our study on the testimonies of 15 sex workers in Brussels and Charleroi, who work as ‘independents’ in very different contexts and whom we have followed since 2020. \r\nThis longitudinal approach enables us to highlight the effects of decriminalisation on self-affirmation as a ‘sex worker’ and on the relationship with clients and their entourage, as reflected in the changes in their testimonies. Using the framework of professional identity analysis, we discuss the effects of decriminalisation on the ‘negotiation’ of professional identity, paying particular attention to the material dimension, which remains preponderant in the testimonies.","Samenvatting: Escorts sustain their livelihood through the provision of sexual services advertised on online platforms. They physically meet clients in often unfamiliar locations, such as hotels or the client’s home. Meeting clients in unknown locations exposes escorts to various risks, including physical violence, stalking, and extortion. Surprisingly, few participants in this study disclose such victimisation. Instead, they underscore the varied safety measures applied before, during, and after a date. Escorts thoroughly screen clients before meeting them; they check rooms for hidden cameras, share their live location with friends or chauffeurs, and report untrustworthy or violent clients on an online blacklist to caution other escorts.  \r\nThis presentation discusses the results of 28 in-depth interviews with cisgender female escorts working in the Netherlands and Belgium. The focal point of this discussion revolves around the firsthand experiences of this hidden and hard-to-reach group concerning safety during this often-called high-risk profession. Further, we zoom in on various safety measures these women implement to ensure their safety. Acknowledging the disparate legal frameworks in both nations, the presentation also explores the repercussions of regulation in the Netherlands and decriminalisation in Belgium. The presentation provides a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by female escorts. It offers insights for policymakers and support professionals to enhance the safety and well-being of sex workers.","Samenvatting: The so-called ‘prostitution wars’ risk harming the quality of the research that allows for a better understanding of what is happening and consequently could inform policy.  The debate about which outcomes follow from certain types of legislation and enforcement has probably sparked the fiercest battles. In the past decades, scholars have begun to unravel aspects of the functioning of prostitution markets more rigidly with cutting-edge statistical techniques.  \r\nThe gaps in our understanding of the connections and mechanisms linking policies to the number of sex workers, the quality of their working conditions and the potential harms associated with the sex industry are wanting. Nevertheless, the descriptive research available is suggestive, and the few recent high-quality studies provide us with the beginnings of an answer. Overall, it is safe to conclude that policies, writ large, substantially affect sex workers' safety and health, the number of sex workers, and the impact on society. We summarise the available evidence, also identifying shortcomings and substantial gaps in our knowledge.  \r\nOne field where a handful of scattered but well-designed studies seem to allow some preliminary conclusions is that criminalisation may reduce the size of the market but worsen the risks and perils for the remaining sex workers. The opposite appears to happen in the case of decriminalisation: an increase in the supply of the number of sex workers, but overall better working conditions and fewer risks.  \r\nThese conclusions, however, remain preliminary, given the overall scarcity of well-designed studies and the lack of reliable data.","Samenvatting: In the Netherlands, rising ageism and labor shortages have amplified the role of informal caregivers, who increasingly assume responsibilities once handled by professional care services. Despite informal caregivers growing importance in today’s society, welfare policies often prioritize paid employment as the ideal form of social participation, neglecting the value of informal caregiving and overlooking the reality that many welfare recipients are unable to participate in the labor market.\r\nWhile abundant research exists on the role of informal caregiving in Western societies, its significance for welfare recipients remains understudied. This study addresses this gap through 40 semi-structured interviews conducted across three municipalities. Through the lens of Social Reproduction Theory, the research provides insights into how personal circumstances, policies, and social norms intersect to shape the meaning and value recipients derive from caregiving. \r\nOur findings reveal the duality of informal caregiving's value for recipients: while it can provide meaning and fulfillment, it can also limit their ability to pursue employment. A particularly important aspect of this study is the experience of single parents, predominantly mothers, who provide intensive caregiving for their disabled children. These parents receive benefits for extended periods and find it nearly impossible to transition out of the system. Despite these hardships, many view their caregiving as a valuable contribution to society—a contribution that is often overlooked by society or even penalized by existing policies. This underscores the need for policy reform to broaden the definition of valuable work to include caregiving activities, recognizing them as legitimate contributions, and, more importantly, finding ways to support caregiving recipients accordingly.","Samenvatting: In Dutch policies like the passende zorg framework, informal carers are given a prominent position in relieving the pressure on professional care related to an aging population and workforce shortage. At the same time, such policy frameworks also acknowledge the burdens on informal carers and the need to alleviate these. In this study we bring this policy paradox into dialogue with the lived experiences of informal carers of people with acquired brain injury and people with physical disabilities who receive long term care. Innovative of this research is our narrative approach. Narrative methodology is eligible for studying both the meaning and consequences of policy, as policymaking entails the creation of selective and persuasive narratives, intended to guide people’s behavior in specific directions. Their plots are powerful as they bring forward culturally shared ways of understanding societal issues and have real life consequences. To bring these into dialogue with lived experiences, we studied books from the collection (‘patientervaringsverhalen.nl’) that provides rich, first-person narratives about care. Policy documents and books were analyzed with storyline analysis as developed by Murray and Sools. This method addresses narrative meaning-making on the personal, interactional and socio-cultural level and is particularly designed to study narratives as holistic meaning units, by analyzing and connecting different story elements. Consequently, different plot structures can be identified across data, to demonstrate friction in meaning-making within and between different narratives. We share preliminary results of our ongoing work and reflect on our methodology.","Samenvatting: A large part of the help in the Netherlands is given by relatives or friends of people with health disabilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw indications that during a situation of reduced professional care, not all caregivers start giving more help: some do not change or provide less help. It is, however, unclear to what extent these findings apply to future spells of reduced professional care, which are likely to occur due to increasing labor shortages in the care sector. Furthermore, it is unclear how these spells may affect specific groups of caregivers, such as women. It is feared that the pressure will mainly fall on them. \r\nPrevious research has shown that the Informal Care Model (ICM) is a useful tool to explain how caregivers respond to changing circumstances, related to need to provide care, its barriers and care beliefs. However, it is not known whether the same characteristics play a role in informal care by men as in women. Moreover, self-reported changes in informal caregiving may be biased. With a longitudinal design, this bias can be reduced, allowing us to determine with more certainty whether ICM-characteristics in men and women are associated with increases or decreases in the provision of informal care. \r\nIn this paper we investigate, based on the LISS panel, gender differences in changes in informal caregiving intensity. We run multi nominal regression models. If it turns out that barriers and beliefs play a much less important role in women than in men, women may take on too much informal tasks more easily. In that case, policy aimed at strengthening informal care should pay extra attention to gender differences.","Samenvatting: The negative impact of caregiving on mental health and well-being is well-established. Previous studies found that caregiver burden depends on the location of caregiving, namely whether it occurs inside or outside the caregivers household. In this study, we delve deeper into the differences in caregiver burden by caregiving location, in order to understand how the characteristics of inside- and outside-household caregiving arrangements – namely by the intensity of caregiving, the number of tasks, and the motivations to provide care –  relate to caregiving burden. \r\nUsing multi-level models on Dutch caregiving data from 2020 collected in the LISS panel (4,846 caregiving relationships of 2,648 caregivers), we found that inside compared to outside household care was related to higher intensity of caregiving, more tasks provided, and the perceived obligation to provide care. These factors similarly contribute to the understanding the driving forces behind caregiving burden. These findings indicate that it is not the location per se that explains higher levels of burden but rather the differences that come with caring for someone in their household. We argue that this supports the claim that to account for future developments of caregiving, more detailed information on the exact caregiving situation – instead of focusing on inside and outside household care alone – is needed.","Samenvatting: Objectives - The aging population and increasing care demands intensify the burden on informal caregivers, particularly for individuals with dementia. This study examines the relationship between assistive technologies and caregiver burden, as well as perseverance time, for caregivers of community-dwelling individuals with dementia.\r\nDesign - An online survey measured objective burden (length of caregiving in years/months and weekly hours spent on caregiving tasks) and subjective burden (experienced burden, quality of life, caregiving satisfaction, and perseverance time) using validated instruments. Data were collected on caregiver and care recipient demographics, housing and neighborhood characteristics, the presence of assistive technologies, and preferences for non-present technologies.\r\nSetting and Participants - The study included 349 informal caregivers of individuals with dementia living at home. Participants either cohabited with or lived within a 10-minute travel distance of the care recipient.\r\nMethods - Multivariate logistic regression models examined the associations between assistive technologies in the care recipient’s home, caregiver burden, and perseverance time, accounting for residential, environmental, and demographic factors. The association between the most desired yet unavailable assistive technology and perceived perseverance time extension was analyzed. \r\nResults - A greater number of assistive technologies was associated with higher odds of achieving above-median CarerQol-7D scores and perseverance times. Also, caregivers identified various assistive technologies they perceived as potentially extending perseverance time by one month.\r\nConclusions - Assistive technologies help reduce caregiver burden and may support sustained at-home care for individuals with dementia, highlighting their potential to ease caregiver strain and promote sustainable aging in place.","Samenvatting: Due to various societal developments, more people will become working informal caregivers (WICs) in the near future. Given that work and informal care, independently and in interrelation, are time- and energy-demanding, WICs (temporarily or permanently) reduce their working hours, choose less demanding jobs, and/or chase career progression to a lesser degree in order to cope with the combination. It is likely that these strategies will negatively affect income of WICs over time. This is why we set out to discover: what are the long-term consequences of starting informal care on working hours and income in individuals who were contractually employed when they started informal caregiving? To answer this research question, we merged SCP-data on informal care (2019) with Statistics Netherlands data on working hours and income (2012-2019). We looked at individuals who were not providing informal care in 2012 and followed them until 2019 and thus looked at possible labor outcomes across 8 years in those who started to provide informal care during these years. For this, we transformed SCP-data to act like panel data, and conducted fixed effects regression analyses on the merged data. In the analyses, starting to provide informal care was the independent, and working hours and income the dependent variables. In all analyses, we controlled for period effects, young children within the household, and life phase. Subgroup analyses were performed and all analyses were split according to gender of the WIC. Currently, the analyses are being finalized and results will become available at the conference.","Samenvatting: Een ziekenhuisopname vormt vaak een scharniermoment, niet alleen voor de zorgvrager maar ook voor diens mantelzorger. Mantelzorgers nemen hierbij diverse rollen op: zo kunnen ze de brug vormen tussen de thuissituatie en het ziekenhuis, zorgen voor rust en continuïteit voor de zorgvrager tijdens zijn / haar verblijf. Tegelijk gaat de opname vaak gepaard met stress en onzekerheden bij zowel de zorgvrager als de mantelzorger. \r\nSteeds meer ziekenhuizen ontwikkelen een beleid rond mantelzorgparticipatie en ondersteuning. Dit wordt aangestuurd door een grotere belangstelling voor persoonsgerichte zorg, patiënt- en familietevredenheid en het tekort aan zorgpersoneel. Voor personeel is het betrekken van mantelzorgers niet altijd vanzelfsprekend, en kan dit rolconflicten en nieuwe uitdagingen brengen.\r\nIn deze bijdrage stellen we de resultaten voor van een kwalitatief verkennend onderzoek in een Gents ziekenhuis dat recent een beleid ontwikkelde en uitrolde rond mantelzorgparticipatie. Hoe ervaren de drie partijen binnen de triade (zorgvragers – mantelzorgers – professionals) de mantelzorgparticipatie en -ondersteuning in de ziekenhuiscontext? Via semi-gestructureerde interviews met 9 mantelzorgers, 4 zorgvragers en 13 professionele zorgverleners brachten we perspectieven, aandachtspunten en succesfactoren voor triadisch werken in kaart.\r\nGebaseerd op deze resultaten en een verkenning van good practices in andere Vlaamse ziekenhuizen formuleren we een aantal concrete good practices en aanbevelingen voor triadisch werken in de ziekenhuiscontext. Het onderzoek toont dat het actief vormgeven van de relatie tussen zorgvrager, mantelzorger en professionele hulpverleners, kan bijdragen tot een hogere ervaren kwaliteit van zorg en voordelen voor alle partijen.","Samenvatting: Door de groeiende vraag naar langdurige zorg krijgt ook de familie als bron van zorg steeds meer aandacht. Voor volwassen kinderen van ouders met een zorgbehoefte kan dit uitdagend zijn, omdat zij vaak willen zorgen, maar barrières ervaren door lange reistijden of verantwoordelijkheden voor eigen families of betaald werk. Als er broers of zussen zijn wordt vaak samen overwogen wie voor een ouder zorgt. Dit zijn vooral dochters en kinderen met minder barrieres. Dit roept de vraag op hoe de zorgpatronen van volwassen kinderen en hun broers of zussen zijn veranderd als gevolg van maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen zoals kleiner wordende families of de terugtrekkende welvaartsstaat. Daarom onderzoekt deze studie of de invloed van kenmerken van volwassen kinderen of van hun broers of zussen op zorggebruik is veranderd. Deze studie is gebaseerd op twee aanvullende studies van de Longitudinal Ageing Study of Amsterdam (LASA): In 2001 werd hiermee informele zorg binnen families in kaart gebracht en in 2023 werd dit herhaald als onderdeel van het FAMCARE project. Alle families met ten minste twee kinderen waarin de ouders thuis wonen zijn geïncludeerd in deze studie (2001: N=186 ouders en 702 kinderen, 2023: 123 ouders en 317 kinderen). Voorlopige resultaten laten zien dat volwassen kinderen zowel in 2001 als in 2023 vaker zorg geven wanneer hun broers of zussen ook zorgen. Daarnaast geven zij ook vaker zorg als zij dicht bij hun ouders wonen en broers of zussen verder weg. Verschillen in zorgpatronen tussen zonen en dochters zijn in 2023 licht afgenomen.","Samenvatting: Met de toenemende vergrijzing en diversiteit groeien de zorg- en ondersteuningsnoden van ouderen met een migratieachtergrond. Het bieden van zorg aan deze groep vormt vaak een uitdaging voor zorg- en welzijnsprofessionals. Ouderen met een migratieachtergrond maken door diverse barrières weinig gebruik van professionele zorg- en welzijnsdiensten. Ook worden mantelzorgers weinig betrokken als volwaardige zorgpartners, dit terwijl ze voor veel ouderen met een migratieachtergrond verantwoordelijk zijn voor de zorg van hun dierbaren. Dit benadrukt de noodzaak aan meer competenties in divers-sensitieve zorg en mantelzorgbetrokkenheid bij zorg- en welzijnsprofessionals. \r\nBinnen het Erasmus+ DI.S.C.O.P.M.B. project werd via de ‘Double Diamond’-methodiek een leerpakket ontwikkeld om competenties in divers-sensitieve zorg te versterken bij zorg- en welzijnsprofessionals en studenten. Het proces doorliep vier fasen: Discover, Define, Develop en Deliver. Het leerpakket bestaat uit 4 hoofdstukken: (1) persoonsgerichte zorg in diversiteit, (2) barrières in toegang tot professionele gezondheids- en welzijnszorg, (3) stereotypen en vooroordelen, en (4) divers-sensitieve communicatie. Verschillende kennisbronnen zoals wetenschappelijke literatuur, ervaringskennis, storytelling-interviews en best practices werden geïntegreerd. \r\nHet leerpakket werd getest en geëvalueerd in de partnerlanden door 276 deelnemers, waaronder master- en bachelorstudenten in zorgopleidingen en professionals. Daarnaast werden in de partnerlanden ook focusgroepen georganiseerd met ouderen met een migratieachtergrond, hun mantelzorgers en zorg- en welzijnsprofessionals. Hierbij werd ingezoomd op ervaringen met professionele gezondheids- en welzijnszorg en persoonsgerichte, divers-sensitieve aanpak. \r\nTijdens de presentatie worden het ontwikkelingsproces, de inhoud en de resultaten van het leerpakket en de resultaten van de focusgroepen besproken.","Samenvatting: De toenemende levensverwachting in Europa heeft geleid tot een verschuiving van dodelijke naar invaliderende aandoeningen bij ouderen, waardoor zorg een cruciale rol speelt in het behoud van hun welbevinden. Informele zorg door partners en kinderen vormt de kern van mantelzorg, maar dit wordt steeds vaker aangevuld met formele en private zorg. Deze complexe zorgnetwerken brengen nieuwe uitdagingen met zich mee, vooral met betrekking tot de psychologische impact op zowel zorgverleners als zorgontvangers. Deze studie vult twee kennislacunes in. Ten eerste wordt onderzocht hoe het functioneren van het zorgnetwerk van invloed is op het welbevinden van de zorgontvanger. Waar eerdere onderzoeken zich vaak afzonderlijk richtten op zorgverleners en zorgontvangers, wordt in deze studie o.a. onderzocht in welke mate de belasting van de zorgverlener het welbevinden van de zorgontvanger beïnvloedt. Daarnaast worden aspecten zoals conflicten, regie over de zorg en voldoende zorg, meegenomen in de analyse. Dit wordt onderzocht in twee tijdsgewrichten (2001 en 2023). Demografische en beleidsmatige veranderingen, zoals het beleid van \"langer thuis wonen,\" hebben de druk op informele zorg vergroot. Tegelijkertijd is de beschikbaarheid van mantelzorg afgenomen door dalende geboortecijfers en veranderende gezinsstructuren. De studie onderzoekt of het perspectief van de zorgverlener in de periode 2001–2023 belangrijker is geworden. Met data van de Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA), die zowel de zorgverleners (partners en kinderen) als de zorgontvangers omvat, biedt dit onderzoek inzichten in hoe zorgnetwerken het welbevinden beïnvloeden.","Samenvatting: De vergrijzing doet de vraag naar mantelzorg toenemen. Partners zijn de eerste aanbieders van zorg wanneer iemand gezondheidsproblemen heeft. In dit onderzoek wordt onderzocht in hoeverre het verlenen van informele zorg aan of het ontvangen van informele zorg van de partner van invloed is op de tevredenheid met de partnerrelatie. Er worden tegengestelde hypothesen geformuleerd. Een negatief effect is te verwachten omdat een informele zorgsituatie stress kan veroorzaken en de gelijkwaardigheid tussen partners kan verminderen, wat voor beide de relatietevredenheid kan schaden. Een positief effect is te verwachten omdat het verlenen van zorg vaak leidt tot een hechtere relatie met degene die zorg krijgt en omdat dankbaarheid jegens de partner bij de ontvanger van zorg van hulp de relatietevredenheid ten goede kan komen. Zestien waves van Nederlandse paneldata (LISS), verzameld tussen 2008 en 2023, werden gecombineerd. De gegevens omvatten 84.306 observaties van 16.205 unieke respondenten; 2.631 observaties registreerden de zorgverlening aan de partner en 2.289 observaties registreerden het ontvangen van zorg van de partner. Voorlopige analyses met fixed effects laten zien dat relatietevredenheid negatief gerelateerd is aan het verlenen van partnerzorg, maar positief gerelateerd aan het ontvangen van partnerzorg. Vrouwen die zorg verlenen aan hun partner vertonen een grotere vermindering van de relatietevredenheid dan mannen. Het effect van het ontvangen van zorg van de partner verschilt niet tussen mannen en vrouwen.","Samenvatting: De vergrijzing en afnemende publieke zorg hebben in de afgelopen decennia geleid tot een grotere afhankelijkheid van informele zorg. Kinderen zijn vaak, naast de partner, zorgverleners voor hun ouders. Dit onderzoek vergelijkt de zorgsituatie en zorglast van kinderen in 2001 en 2023 met data uit de Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA). Het doel is inzicht te krijgen in hoe veranderingen in demografie en beleid de zorglast beïnvloeden.\r\nFactoren zoals kleinere gezinnen, hogere arbeidsparticipatie en langer thuis wonen maken de zorg voor een ouder mogelijk complexer, terwijl een betere gezondheid een positief effect kan hebben op zorglast. Deze studie onderzoekt determinanten van zorglast, zoals zorgintensiteit, secundaire stressoren (bijv. werkdruk) en positieve (emotionele steun) en negatieve (conflicten) aspecten van hulp van anderen worden.\r\nWe onderzoeken in welke mate determinanten van zorglast zijn veranderd tussen 2001 en 2023, en we veronderstellen dat de impact van deze determinanten op zorglast is toegenomen door minder keuzemogelijkheden en een groter gevoel van verplichting om te zorgen door beleidsveranderingen \r\nVoorlopige resultaten tonen aan dat in 2023 in vergelijking met 2001 zorgontvangers een betere fysieke gezondheid hadden, ondanks een hogere leeftijd. Kinderen hadden minder broers of zussen, werkten vaker en deelden zorg minder vaak. De zorgintensiteit was lager en de zorglast was gelijk in 2023 in vergelijking met 2001. Contact, behoefte aan hulp en conflicten hadden in 2023 een grotere impact op de zorglast dan in 2001.\r\nDit onderzoek benadrukt de noodzaak van beleid dat zorgdeling tussen familieleden faciliteert en ondersteunt om de toekomstige zorgdruk te verlichten.","Samenvatting: In het hoger onderwijs combineren veel studenten hun studie met de zorg voor een familielid, vriend of buur met een ziekte, beperking, psychische kwetsbaarheid, ouderdom of verslavingsproblematiek. Deze student-mantelzorgers zijn vaak onzichtbaar en missen daardoor erkenning en ondersteuning. Het alliantieproject van de Hogeschool Gent (HOGENT) en de Erasmus hogeschool Brussel (EhB) onderzocht de noden van deze studenten en de bereidheid van het onderwijspersoneel om hen te ondersteunen. \r\nVia kwantitatieve bevragingen deelden 105 student-mantelzorgers hun ervaringen over de impact van hun zorgrol op studeren en het studentenleven, evenals hun behoefte aan ondersteunende onderwijs- en examenmaatregelen. Daarnaast gaven 113 onderwijsgevenden inzicht in hun houding tegen mantelzorgvriendelijke maatregelen.  De resultaten tonen een negatieve impact van mantelzorg op studeren en een brede bereidheid bij onderwijsgevenden om ondersteunende maatregelen toe te passen.\r\nNaast het onderzoek werden verschillende sensibiliseringsacties opgezet, zoals de campagne ‘Mooie woorden en beelden’, waarin studenten en lesgevers woorden en beelden inzonden die voor hen mantelzorg symboliseerde. \r\nHet project concludeert dat een mantelzorgvriendelijk onderwijsbeleid onmisbaar is. Dit vereist dat een hoger onderwijsinstelling eerst een duidelijke visie ontwikkelt, waarna de opleidingen deze visie kunnen vertalen naar concrete maatregelen die aansluiten bij de specifieke noden en mogelijkheden.","Samenvatting: \r\nThis research examines the preferences and challenges patients with a migration background face when making medical decisions. Based on existing literature, two hypotheses are formulated: First, patients with a migration background may prefer to limit or conceal stressful medical information, differing from EU healthcare norms that emphasize direct and honest communication. Second, non-EU migrants often involve their families more in health-related decisions. Additionally, other sociodemographic characteristics and the specifics of the clinical case are considered.\r\nTo test these hypotheses, a vignette survey is developed featuring two hypothetical scenarios describing clinical consultations regarding cancer and depression diagnoses, with the latter varying in severity. Respondents (potential patients) indicate their preferences for family involvement and information disclosure using adaptations of existing scales by Ende (1989), Alden (2015, 2018), and Müller-Engelsmann (2013). Furthermore, detailed sociodemographic and economic information is collected.\r\nThe survey is part of The Social Study (TSS) and aims to gather data from a representative sample of the Belgian population aged 16 years or older in 2024, with approximately 1,500 respondents. Regression analyses are conducted to examine the effect of migration background on preferences for family involvement and information disclosure across the two vignettes, accounting for other sociodemographic and economic characteristics as well as the severity of the medical condition in the depression vignette. This research highlights the importance of culturally sensitive healthcare practices that address the needs of migrant populations in Belgium’s medical decision-making processes.\r\n","Samenvatting: Context: Women present for abortion at widely varying gestational ages because of myriad barriers they may face along their trajectory and because of inequitable access to abortion care. Mapping women’s trajectories to abortion care and identifying barriers experienced within can inform policy decisions on abortion care.\r\nMethods: A structured survey was completed by 498 women presenting for abortion at five (Dutch-speaking) abortion centers in Belgium. Bivariate analyses examined differences in the duration of abortion trajectories, and associations with experienced barriers were assessed.\r\nResults: Women who presented later significantly took more time in the first stages of the abortion trajectory. 42.0% of the respondents weren’t able to recognize the symptoms they experienced as pregnancy symptoms, and 36.7% didn’t experience any typical pregnancy symptoms. 35.2% consulted a/their GP before they contacted the abortion center. For more than 95%, the choice for abortion is sure to entirely determined at the first consultation, around 50% of respondents indicated that it was still a difficult choice to make. About 40.1 % reported feeling ashamed for choosing abortion, and 38.5% reported being disappointed in themselves for this reason. Fear of the procedure and associated pain was also seen as a major barrier by 45.4%. \r\nConclusion: This study highlights the multifaceted barriers women face along their trajectories to abortion care in Flanders, Belgium. The results underscore the need for improved accessibility to abortion care, enhanced reproductive health education, and supportive policies that address both the psychological and practical barriers to obtaining abortion care.\r\n","Samenvatting: Diabetes is an increasingly significant global health issue, affecting approximately 74 million adults and 300,000 children and adolescents across Europe. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that diabetes-related deaths could double between 2005 and 2030, primarily due to an aging population and rising risk factors such as obesity and sedentary lifestyles. By 2045, it is projected that one in ten Europeans will be living with diabetes.\r\nAs a chronic condition, diabetes requires long-term management to prevent complications. Nevertheless, healthcare systems are facing pressure from rising demand and workforce shortages. Informal care networks (family, friends, and communities) are becoming increasingly vital in supporting diabetes patients. While diabetes is primarily a physical illness, social and behavioral factors significantly influence disease management, coping mechanisms, and patient support. Social networks can promote healthier lifestyles, enhance access to information and resources, and provide both emotional and practical assistance.\r\nDespite the acknowledged importance of social networks, research on their role in diabetes care has yielded mixed results. Some studies indicate that strong social relationships can improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of diabetes, while others find no significant correlation. This study aims to explore these inconsistencies by investigating the impact of social capital (both bonding and bridging) on diabetes prevalence, the likelihood of diagnosis, and disease management. By utilizing objective measures such as biomarkers and cross-national data (SHARE), this research seeks to clarify the role of social networks in diabetes care and contribute to a better understanding of effective support structures.\r\n","Samenvatting: Regular physical activity (PA) benefits various health outcomes, but children and adolescents in single-parent families conduct on average less PA than their peers in two-parent families. Earlier research, however, finds cross-national variation in the association between living with a single parent and the amount of PA in European adolescents. The aim of this study is to examine whether cross-national variation in national levels of PA promotion explains the cross-national variation in the association between living with a single parent and the amount of PA in European adolescents. We hypothesise that this association is weaker in countries with higher national levels of PA promotion. We use data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey, distributed among 11 to 15-year-olds in Europe in 2017/2018, and complement these data with WHO data on national-level PA promotion policies. Mixed multilevel linear and logistic regressions are conducted with respondents clustered in countries and schools and PA outcomes operationalised both as conducting vigorous physical activity (VPA) at least four times a week, and as the number of days a week conducting at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Our results demonstrate the association between living with a single parent and VPA and MVPA, and how it varies cross-nationally, but also indicate that higher national levels of PA promotion neither increase VPA and MVPA, nor moderate the association between living with a single parent and VPA and MVPA in European adolescents.","Samenvatting: Several Dutch educational institutions have adopted the Positive Health (PH) approach to guide and support their students. PH refers to the ability to adapt and self-manage in response to social, physical, and emotional challenges. Structured into six dimensions, it covers mental and physical health, social functioning, and tools for reflection and discussion on these topics. Originally developed for medical contexts, the majority of research on PH still focuses on healthcare domain.\r\nThis study explores whether PH enhances different aspects of student well-being and resilience, under what conditions, and what benefits or barriers exist. Grounded in Sen’s capability approach and resilience theories, we employ a convergent mixed-methods design, integrating survey data and 16 interviews with students and teachers from a Dutch higher education institution that has used PH in student mentoring for three years.\r\nPreliminary findings highlight PH’s potential to initiate conversations on difficult topics and enhance students’ ability to reflect on their health and stressors. The results underscore the teacher’s role as a key moderator between PH and well-being. PH topics—such as mental health and financial stability—extend beyond traditional student-teacher interactions, posing challenges. While PH can reduce inequalities when teachers are well-equipped, gaps in teachers’ skills may disadvantage some students.\r\nTherefore, we recommend investing in teachers’ competencies and ensuring flexible student-teacher pairings. Additionally, in practice, PH conversations often focus on problems rather than strengths, contradicting its core philosophy. To maximize benefits, a greater emphasis on the positive aspects of students' functioning should be encouraged.","Samenvatting: Transitioning into parenthood is a significant life event that can influence subjective well-being, with timing potentially playing a key role. Although deviations from normative parenthood timing are increasingly accepted, norms surrounding parenthood persist in the Netherlands. Descriptive norms (what most people do) are often used as a proxy for prescriptive norms (what most people think should be done), though they are conceptually distinct and function differently. Previous research found a gap of 1.5 to 4 years between the ideal and actual age of parenthood across 29 European countries, raising questions about distinct impacts of each norm on well-being. The present study explored whether deviations from descriptive and prescriptive parenthood age norms are related to well-being namely life satisfaction (LS) and self-esteem (SE), and if these associations differ by gender. Using the Dutch LISS panel (2023, N = 979, Age = 25-50), we defined off-time parenthood via generalized additive models and ran multiple linear regressions with main effects, control variables, and gender interactions. The results show that early parenthood, compared to (prescriptive) on-time parenthood, was associated with lower LS (b = -0.24, p = .024), but this effect disappeared once control variables were included. SE was not significantly related to deviations from prescriptive norms. Deviating from descriptive norms was not significantly related to either LS or SE. We will discuss implications of these results within the Dutch context, exploring how parenthood timing norms did not have the expected impact on well-being, and exploring how future research could further examine these relationships.","Samenvatting: Caregiver wellbeing is a growing concern in ageing societies with rising care demands, as individuals increasingly care for family and friends with health problems, while childcare too comprises a significant share of unpaid care for many. While caregiving can be enriching, it often conflicts with employment or other activities, creating strains in the short-term, but also cumulatively over time. Strains to wellbeing might limit the ability to care or leave caregivers in need of care themselves, particularly when care involvement is heavy. Furthermore, since women typically have care-heavier life-courses, existing inequalities will likely widen as care needs increase. Conversely, having accumulated ‘care capital’ including care-related experience and skills, may allow for better adaptation to care demands, resulting in less ‘wear-and-tear’ over time. Becoming more equipped might further open room for fulfillment with the caregiver role, impacting wellbeing positively. Our study thus examines to what extent unpaid caregiving impacts subjective wellbeing for women and men, considering differences in accumulated care-heaviness. As optimal wellbeing includes high life satisfaction and positive affect, we include both measures. Drawing on role-conflict and life-course theories, and taking an integrated perspective including both informal-and childcare as distinct yet interconnected types of care, we answer (1)to what extent proximate caregiving, including informal care and childcare, influences life satisfaction and happiness for women and men; and (2)how this varies by accumulated care-heaviness. We use retrospective survey data from the Netherlands on informal caregiving, combined with annual childrearing and wellbeing data from the LISS Panel, and run fixed-effects regression models.","Samenvatting: Increases in female labor force participation and female outperformance of men when it comes to educational attainment are two key structural forces in Western societies. They go along with increasing social norms in families for men to participate in housework and childcare, challenging the long-standing male breadwinner norm. This discordance between social norms and economic conditions can be challenging to individuals' wellbeing. In this study, we use British cohort data and biomarker measures of stress consequences to address two research questions: How do men's and women's deviations from the male breadwinner norm (as evidenced by a non-traditional division of labor) relate to physiological stress at age 46? Does the association between a non-traditional division of labor and stress vary by gender attitudes? We analyze data from the 1970 British Cohort Study, a cohort study of all 17,000 Brits born in one week of 1970. The data allow us to assess the division of labour at ages 30, 34, and 42 by combining information on family formation (partnership and childbirth), employment, housework and earning patterns. Our outcome variable is allostatic load, measured at age 46. Allostatic load is a measure of physiological consequences to the experience of chronic stress. Preliminary results suggest that having a non-traditional division of labor that deviates from the male breadwinner norm may be associated with higher levels of chronic stress for men and women, but so are strongly gendered patterns. Sharing responsibility for income and housework appears to be most beneficial for both genders.","Samenvatting: While female homemakers were once considered key contributors to the unpaid workforce, their current level of civic engagement (e.g., volunteering and informal caregiving) compared to that of working women remains uncertain. Previous research has largely focused on employed versus unemployed individuals or retirees, often grouping homemakers with other inactive individuals and overlooking homemaking as a distinct status that may shape civic engagement.\r\nThe absence of a work role could allow for greater civic engagement due to fewer time constraints, yet detachment from the labor market might reduce social integration, limiting engagement. These dynamics likely depend on children and their age, as school-aged children, for example, require less care and can enhance social integration through institutions like schools and sports clubs that encourage parental volunteering. Additionally, as societies have become more individualized and gender roles have modernized, both civic engagement patterns and the homemaker role have evolved.\r\nOur research asks: “How does the civic engagement of women differ when they are homemaking compared to when they are working, and what role do children and the historical context play?” Using data from the Swiss Household Panel (1999–2023) and fixed-effects regression models, we build on prior between-person studies. Preliminary findings indicate that homemakers are as likely to volunteer as working women but dedicate more hours and engage more in informal caregiving. We find no evidence that these relationships significantly vary based on the presence or age of children, nor when comparing two generations of women—those born before and after 1965.","Samenvatting: Given the ongoing disparity in housework time between men and women, the question arises to what extent and under what circumstances parents transmit gendered household work patterns to their children. Applying theories of (gender role) socialization, we investigate the intergenerational transmission of time spent on housework. Specifically, we examine how fathers’ and mothers’ housework time influences that of their sons and daughters. Additionally, we investigate how these influences vary across key life course stages: children living in the parental home, living alone, living with a partner, and living with a partner and children. We hypothesize that the intergenerational transmission of housework time is stronger in same-sex parent-child dyads than in opposite-sex dyads, with the effect particularly strong in father-son dyads. Moreover, we predict that the resemblance between parents’ and children’s housework time is stronger the more similar children’s living situations are to those of their parents during their upbringing, that is, when they and their partners have children. We use data from the German Socioeconomic Panel (1984–2022), which includes annual self-reported information on time dedicated to housework for all household members. We analyze a sample of approximately 5,000 sons and daughters born between 1970 and 2002 who were raised in two-parent households until age 15. A preliminary analysis reveals various correlations between parents’ average housework time before their children turn 15 and the children’s own average housework time after the age of 15, depending on the sex of the parent and child. Regression models will further assess this association.","Samenvatting: This study explores the residential transitions of young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering a novel perspective by integrating insights from both the 2008 financial crisis and the 2021 COVID-19 crisis. Using a life course perspective, we examine how historical timing, life events (e.g., leaving/returning home), and socioeconomic conditions (e.g., income, education, gender, and regional disparities) shape young adults’ housing trajectories. Our key research questions are: (1) How do economic crises influence young adults' residential independence? (2) What socio-economic and gendered dynamics drive leaving and returning home? Using Statbel register data (1993–2023), we apply logistic regression models to calculate the probability of leaving and returning home, controlling for selection bias with the Heckman Selection Model. This innovative approach provides new insights into how crises shape housing trajectories, showing delayed residential independence, with a narrowing gender gap in return rates. By uniquely combining past and present crises, our study delivers policy recommendations to enhance future pandemic preparedness, ensuring better support for vulnerable youth in housing and economic stability.","Samenvatting: The aim of this study is to explore the academic performance of adolescents who are living with their single parents. Living with single parents is challenging experience especially when children are in adolescence phase. The core aim of study was to investigate how family environment, social status and parental support affect adolescents’ academic performance. This study is carried out in Punjab, Pakistan on adolescents who are experiencing the single family environment either my divorce or natural parental marital transition. Qualitative methodology was employed to evaluate the different aspects of aspects of academic performance. A sample of 40 students in-between age 14 to 18 years was selected from different institutions coming from different socio cultural backgrounds and having different family situations comprising different types of single family structure. Data was collected through semi structured interviews to explore the academics performance and family dynamics. Findings of the study indicated that adolescents living with single parents show poor academic performance due to lack of interest, absentees, poor social and economic support, less parental involvement. Students were showing less or no interest in extracurricular activities and less social interaction with fellows. Parental economic status , Parenting style, parental involvement and academic support are the key factors which directly academic outcomes. Research experience was challenging because students were reluctant to share family issues. Proper academic and counselling centre should be established to provide emotional and academic counselling for such students. Longitudinal research should be carried out to trace the academic outcomes and social adjustments.","Samenvatting: The young adult life phase has changed substantially in recent years. Overall, young adulthood is increasingly characterized by uncertainty. This manifests in various ways: precarity at work, postponement of steps toward adulthood, and more unstable living situations and relationships. This paper maps the life-course of young people today. It does so by socioeconomic background. Although young people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may have the most difficulty to achieve the traditional steps to adulthood (e.g., leaving home), they are also expected to have the most intention to achieve these steps. As uncertainty might spill over from one domain to another, such as from the work to the housing domain, this paper takes a multi-domain approach shifting away from the focus in demographic literature on single transitions. Using Dutch register data for all young people in the Netherlands over the period 2011 to 2021, we employ Latent Class Analyses based on different aspects of the housing, family and work situation of young people. The results reveal a shift over time, as well as differences between individuals of lower and higher SES backgrounds.","Samenvatting: In today’s world, family institution is facing turbulations and young people’s pathways towards adulthood are evolving through intergenerational exchanges that shape their prolonged navigation of responsibility. In this systematic review, I reflect on the phenomenon of prolonged transitions into adulthood, using intergenerational family support and the emergence of “Waithood” globally as a focus. Utilizing structured PRISMA guided analysis, I review the literature on waithood within a range of cultural contexts. I integrate perspectives from a life course theory approach, emerging adulthood, and varied culture-oriented notions of youth dependency. Analysis of this literature reveals an overall trend of prolonged transitional phases of becoming an adult experienced by youth universally, but the factors present in affluent societies versus resource-limited societies vary significantly. Families as a unit bear increasing economic responsibilities for adult children who cannot achieve traditional milestones of adulthood, which modifies the relationship of individual family members to each other, and impacts expectations of reciprocity. I also offer some critical reflections regarding gendered experiences in prolonged transitions that delineates important elements of distinct societal pressures and coping strategies among adolescents and young adult women and men. It is critical to note the agency youth demonstrate in responding to prolonged transitions as they employ innovative strategies of change in adulthood norms, formal entrepreneurship, and migration among other examples. However, despite extensive coverage, I found paucity of literature on comparative cross-cultural dynamics. Consequently, I identify gaps for future research, to emphasize comparative studies between Global North and South with different demographic and welfare state conditions.","Samenvatting: Following the rise in unpartnered individuals, research is becoming increasingly attentive to the multi-faceted nature of how “being single” is perceived and experienced. A broad division is made between those considering their single status as their personal choice and those who would rather have a partner (Stein, 1978). Next, how singlehood is experienced has been found to vary by demographic factors, with e.g. women more likely to be satisfied with being single than men (Hoan & MacDonald, 2024; Yang & Chang, 2024), and middle-aged adults to be less satisfied than individuals of other age groups (Yu & Hara, 2023). These variations are important to recognise, as the way the single status is defined relates to satisfaction with the situation and, in turn, overall well-being. Given the worldwide rise in singlehood, understanding how the intersection between one’s self-definition of singlehood and demographic characteristics functions in light of singlehood satisfaction is becoming increasingly relevant. \r\nThis study builds upon existing research by examining in detail how individuals’ self-definition of singlehood relates to their satisfaction with being single, using the recently released 2024 singlehood module from the Gender and Generations Survey II (GGS). Chi-square tests assessed associations between key demographic characteristics (gender, age, and education level) and self-definition of singlehood, while Kruskal-Wallis tests examined how the intersections between demographics and self-definitions were associated with satisfaction with singlehood. \r\nBy focusing on variations within the single population, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how personal definitions of singlehood shape satisfaction, offering insights into the diversity of singlehood experiences. \r\n","Samenvatting: As Dutch primary schools become increasingly diverse in terms of ethnicity, race, religion, gender, and sexuality, parents are confronted with new challenges in their parenting practices. Based on a study funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO), this research uses a multi-sited ethnographic design and compares two cases: a school in a gentrified Amsterdam neighbourhood with a 50/50 ethnic mix in terms of migration background, and a school in a medium-sized Dutch city with a similar composition but situated in a working-class context.\r\nThrough interviews with parents, teachers, and school leaders, the project explores how parenting strategies are shaped by social class, previous experiences with diversity, and the school’s and teachers’ approaches to diversity. The study critically engages with questions of colour-blind versus colour-conscious parenting, the emotional and practical labour involved in navigating diversity, and the often unspoken role white parents play in sustaining or challenging educational inequalities.\r\nIt contributes to broader debates on racial socialization, inclusion in education, and the sociology of parenting, while also raising questions about how diversity is experienced and negotiated in everyday school and family contexts.","Samenvatting: Dutch Gymnasium schools have traditionally been known as predominantly white elite secondary schools (Merry and Boterman 2020). This article centres around students in Dutch Gymnasium schools who have a migration background and/or parents with -at most- a lower vocational education level . As their parents oftentimes didn’t attend an academic track in secondary school, these two groups of students are therefore “newcomers” to the Gymnasium school context. This newcomer position, together with the elitist image of the school and being a minority within a rather homogenous student body in terms of ethnic background (being without migration background) and education level of parents (being at the level of university of applied sciences and research university), raises the question how a sense of belonging in Gymnasium schools is experienced by “newcomer” students within these schools. It also begs the question how social boundaries in Gymnasium schools occur and how these schools can become more inclusive spaces, where “newcomers” aren’t just allowed to be present, but are also seen as equally belonging to that space, including their commonalities with and differences from the more “traditional” Gymnasium students.","Samenvatting: \r\nIn this paper, we present stories of discrimination and disadvantage within Amsterdam’s education system, shared by parents and students of color and/or those with a migration background. These stories expose feelings and perspectives on discrimination and racism. Despite more than 40 years of policies aimed at addressing these issues, significant challenges remain. The stories highlight a wide range of concerns, including communication difficulties between schools and parents, conflicts within schools, low educational quality, and acts of discrimination. We will also reflect on the process of presenting these stories to a citizens' assembly, composed of 50 individuals representing migrant parents and parents of color in the city. This assembly developed bottom-up recommendations for school boards, the municipal government, and policymakers in education and other relevant fields in the city, aiming to combat racism and discrimination in education.","Samenvatting: In our everyday encounters at higher education institutions in the Netherlands, we experience that diversity discomfort can severely hamper the creation of inclusive environments. Based on interdisciplinary critical literature, in this conceptual article we show that the unease that can arise from engaging with diverse people and perspectives often leads to the reproduction of power hierarchies. At the same time, we argue for the need to consider diversity discomfort as a catalyst for awareness and transformation. We draw upon literature focusing on power relations and learning theories, including concepts such as safe and brave space and pedagogy of discomfort. While doing so, we present some strategies and formulate a new research agenda on how to transform diversity discomfort from a barrier into a resource to create future-proof, meaningful, equitable higher education.","Samenvatting: Research on sexual harassment (SH) prevalence in higher education has resulted in a wide range of prevalence rates (Bondestam and Lundqvist, 2020). In general, studies asking about self-labelled SH have led to much lower prevalence rates than studies presenting a specified list of sexually transgressive behaviours (STB) to their respondents. A common explanation for this prevalence gap is the inability of respondents to interpret their own sexually transgressive experience accurately because of false beliefs, such as rape myths and heteronormative sexual scripts (e.g. Hockett et al. 2017; Jenkins, 2017). However, not only in practice but also in research such limited understanding of SH prevails: Questionnaires including a predefined list of STB have initially been developed from a heteronormative, Global North, and gendered perspective on SH (Fitzgerald et al. 1988). Moreover, most research on SH prevalence has been conducted in Anglo-Saxon environments, with a focus on female students. Using a questionnaire including both SH prevalence measures within a Belgian university, the current study investigates whether this gap is more outspoken for those groups who do not match the ‘ideal victim’ profile and those SH experiences that are inconsistent to widespread false beliefs. Preliminary results show that certain sociodemographic, academic-related and incident-related characteristics influenced the likelihood for this prevalence gap to appear. If we want to strive towards inclusive policy and research in which all voices are heard, it is essential we consider these potential epistemic differences between university groups on what accounts for SH.","Samenvatting: In this paper, we discuss epistemic inequality and marginalization within Belgian higher education. The paper adopts a decolonial perspective to examine knowledge production in academic positions within Belgian higher education spaces. Foregrounding the context of the university, in which anti-colonial knowledge is simultaneously marginalised, the article asks what the possibilities are for decolonial critiques of knowledge within universities. In particular, we consider what it means to conduct decolonial research as an academic in the context of the Belgian university. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with racialized PhD researchers, this paper finds that the university remains a site where epistemic exclusionary practices are reproduced.  Findings show that dominant social science conceptions of scientific validity and neutrality often reproduce the epistemic status quo. The paper exposes how hegemonic conceptions contribute to perpetuating ‘epistemic coloniality,’ marginalizing research that uses a decolonial approach and denying such research validity. The analyses revealed four key findings. First, conducting decolonial research remains a challenging endeavor. Second, racialized researchers' racial backgrounds are often viewed as a weakness, leading to perceptions of 'subjectivity' when studying communities they belong to. Third, participants reported being discouraged and warned against engaging in decolonial content. Finally, critical scholarship on race is frequently dismissed as inherently political, relegating it to a marginalized position within academia. This paper outlines some key tensions and challenges faced by racialized decolonial scholars at both theoretical and methodological levels and overall underscores the need for recognition and effort to embrace critical epistemologies within higher education in Belgium.","Samenvatting: Het welzijn van studenten in het hoger onderwijs staat vaak ter discussie, met name in de nasleep van de Covid-19-pandemie (Versteeg & Kappe, 2021). Daarnaast spelen structurele factoren zoals prestatiedruk en sociale ongelijkheid een belangrijke rol. Studies tonen aan dat prestatiedruk, versterkt door beleidsmaatregelen zoals de bindend studieadviesnorm en sociale vergelijkingen via sociale media, een negatieve invloed kan hebben op het welzijn (Frison & Eggermont, 2016; Klinkenberg, Versteeg & Kappe, 2023; Van der Meer, Jansen & Torenbeek, 2010). Bovendien blijft ongelijkheid in het onderwijs een punt van zorg: studenten met meer sociaal en economisch kapitaal lijken beter te presteren dan hun peers (Kennisrotonde, 2023). Onze analyse bouwt voort op Bourdieu’s concept van sociaal kapitaal (1986), waarbij we onderzoeken hoe studenten met verschillende sociaaleconomische achtergronden verschillen in herstel na COVID-19.\r\nOm deze trends beter te begrijpen, analyseren we data uit de Studentenwelzijnsmonitor (SWM) van Hogeschool Inholland, een longitudinaal survey-onderzoek naar studentenwelzijn. Tussen 2021 en 2024 zijn kernindicatoren zoals depressieve symptomen, veerkracht, prestatiedruk en de invloed van achtergrondkenmerken onderzocht. De eerste resultaten laten significante verbeteringen zien in depressieve symptomen, emotionele uitputting en studiestress. Echter, positieve constructen zoals studiemotivatie en veerkracht tonen minder consistente trends. De invloed van het cohortjaar op welzijnsuitkomsten bleek beperkt, terwijl factoren zoals geslacht, leeftijd en studiejaar een sterkere rol speelden.\r\nTijdens de presentatie bespreken we deze kwantitatieve resultaten in combinatie met verdiepend kwalitatief onderzoek naar prestatiedruk en de ervaringen van eerste-generatiestudenten, dat momenteel wordt uitgevoerd. Ook worden de bevindingen van de SWM uit mei 2025 meegenomen.\r\n•\tBourdieu, P. (1986). The forms of capital. In J.

As such, there is a compelling empirical question to be asked: are religious schools effective in accomplishing one of the main goals of education—to equip students with knowledge and skills to participate effectively in the labor market? Many earlier studies have investigated the relationship between religious schooling and academic achievement and suggested that religious schools may facilitate the accumulation of social capital that subsequently improves achievement. However, only a few studies (from the field of economics) focused on the relationship between religious schooling and labor market outcomes. These studies focused almost exclusively on Catholic schools and were conducted in countries where religious schools are private or where they charge fees and set admission criteria. Due to this, it is difficult to distinguish the effect of religious schooling from the effect of private schooling. In this paper, we contribute to the literature by studying a wide range of school denominations (Catholic, Protestant, Islamic, and Hindu schools) and use administrative data from the Netherlands. This data better allows us to study the effect of religious schooling because all schools in the Netherlands have been funded equally since 1917 and are free of charge, irrespective of their ideological affiliation.","Samenvatting: Research has shown that there is inequality in teachers’ expectations. Teachers, for example, on average expect less from lower-SES students, even if their performance levels are equal to those of higher-SES students. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Scholars posit that it might partly be rooted in the way teachers evaluate their students: studies show that teachers differ in the extent to which they on average consider certain student characteristics when formulating expectations. Research suggests that teachers also differ in the extent to which they use the same standards for all their students. While some teachers use the same standardized data sources and predefined criteria for all students, others rely on different sources and criteria across students. Studies emphasize the importance of using the same standards for all to reduce negative bias. However, adjusting evaluation practices to individual students might come with positive bias for disadvantaged students, which might be necessary to mitigate inequality. Thus, it remains a puzzle how the extent to which teachers rely on the same standardized performance measures when forming expectations for different students, relates to biases in teachers’ expectations for students based on SES and migration background. Using data from the COOL5-18 cohort study, we show that some teachers show a negative, while others show a positive bias against lower-SES students and students with a migration background. Moreover, teachers differ substantially in their reliance on the same standardized measures for all students. We will investigate how this relates to bias in teachers’ expectations using multilevel SEM.","Samenvatting: BACKGROUND Grade retention, or repeating an academic year, is still widely used across countries to address classroom heterogeneity, despite limited evidence regarding its effectiveness. While often framed as a support for struggling students, grade retention may in fact reinforce existing disadvantages, perpetuating educational inequality. Most research on predictors has focused on the student-level, overlooking broader structural contexts influencing grade retention decisions in schools and educational systems. AIMS This study builds on the Dynamic Model of Educational Effectiveness to investigate Q1) which school-level characteristics are associated with grade retention in lower-secondary education across European countries, Q2) how these associations differ between countries; and Q3) which educational-system-level characteristics might explain between-country differences. METHODS Utilizing PISA 2018 data, we conducted multilevel regression analysis to assess fixed (Q1) and random school estimates (Q2), and plan to test interaction effects between school- and system-level variables (Q3). RESULTS Analyzing data from 123,511 students in 5,693 schools across 24 countries, we identified several school characteristics linked to grade retention, grouped into two domains: organizational structure and data use (e.g., ability grouping, selective admission), and school population and resources (e.g., student-body composition and facilities). Importantly, the strength and direction of these associations varied considerably across countries DISCUSSION This paper highlights the importance of school characteristics and educational systems for understanding grade retention from a holistic perspective.  The findings underscore the need for systemic reform to address the institutional conditions that contribute to grade retention, offering valuable insights for policymakers aiming to promote equitable education systems.","Samenvatting: This paper explores the intersection of competitiveness and socioeconomic status (SES) in shaping student outcomes across educational systems. Competitiveness, defined as a “dispositional desire to outperform others,” is deeply embedded in education through practices such as standardized testing, grading on a curve, and public comparisons. While it can motivate students, competitiveness may also exacerbate SES-related achievement gaps—an area largely overlooked in current research.\r\nThe study examines how competitiveness interacts with SES, noting that competitive environments may amplify disadvantages for lower SES students who lack the preparatory resources of their higher SES peers. Psychological models, such as the social class mismatch theory, suggest that schools reflect middle- and upper-class norms, creating barriers for lower SES students. Sociologically, competitiveness is often encouraged by middle- and upper-class parents through achievement-oriented activities, whereas lower SES students may view competition as unfair.\r\nTwo main contributions are highlighted: first, the study differentiates between “experienced” competitiveness (individual perceptions) and “school-level” competitiveness (institutional norms), offering a more nuanced understanding of how competition operates within education. Second, it investigates how educational tracking—sorting students by ability—relates to competitive climates and SES disparities. While tracking is known to reinforce inequality, its role in fostering competitiveness has been underexplored.\r\nUsing data from PISA 2018 and hierarchical linear modeling (N = 365,161), the study addresses two questions: (1) How does SES moderate the impact of competitiveness on academic outcomes and self-perception? and (2) How does educational tracking influence competitiveness? These findings aim to refine theory and inform educational policy on mitigating SES-related inequalities.","Samenvatting: Onderwijs heeft twee kerntaken: bevorderen van prestaties en bestrijden van sociale ongelijkheid. Beide doelen worden vaak incompatibel geacht, waarbij slechts één van de twee optimaal nagestreefd kan worden. Tegenwoordig kent Westers onderwijs een hyperfixatie op prestatie, wat de onderwijsorganisatie beïnvloedt. Van gedifferentieerde onderwijssystemen wordt verwacht dat ze de nationale onderwijsprestatie optimaliseren maar die staan tegelijk gekend om hun sterkere reproductie van sociale ongelijkheid. Die spreidstand tussen prestatie en sociale rechtvaardigheid hoeft niet te bestaan. Scandinavische landen met een comprehensief onderwijssysteem kunnen uitstekende PISA-resultaten voorleggen zonder op sociale gelijkheid in te boeten. Toch blijft de angst bestaan dat comprehensief secundair onderwijs prestaties ondermijnt, voornamelijk doordat sterke leerlingen onvoldoende uitgedaagd worden. Voor dat argument is weinig empirisch bewijs. Onderzoek toont juist aan dat sterke leerlingen minder gevoelig zijn voor invloeden uit hun leeromgeving, zoals klasgenoten en verwachtingen van leerkrachten. Om de impact van comprehensief onderwijs op sterke leerlingen te vatten werd een mixed-methods onderzoek uitgevoerd aan de hand van een multilevel-analyse van PISA 2018-data uit 25 landen en een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse van twee, in 2024 afgenomen focusgroepen met elf participanten in een Vlaamse secundaire school met uitgestelde studiekeuze. De resultaten tonen aan dat de prestatie van sterke leerlingen niet significant afneemt in comprehensief onderwijs doordat peer effects hun prestatie minder sterk beïnvloeden en lerarencultuur geen significante invloed heeft. De resultaten van de focusgroepen liggen in lijn met die redenering. Sterke leerlingen blijven daar sterk presteren door de ondersteuning vanuit hun sociale omgeving en door de gemeenschappelijke en individuele strategieën die ze ontwikkelen.","Samenvatting: Schoolboeken spelen niet enkel een belangrijke rol in het onderwijzen van kinderen maar ze dragen ook bij aan de sociale en culturele beeld-vorming van leerlingen. Binnen de brede waaier aan kennisbronnen over de sociale wereld (familie, televisie, boeken, vrienden, sociale media, enz.) nemen schoolboeken net door hun pedagogische claim naar ‘objectiviteit’  dan ook een geprivilegieerde positie in. Dit maakt het des te opmerkelijker dat de wijze waarop sociale identiteit wordt weergegeven in Vlaamse schoolboeken tot op heden nog weinig of niet werd onderzocht. Deze studie onderzoekt voor het eerst in Vlaanderen hoe gender, etnische diversiteit, sociaaleconomische status, lichaamsvorm en fysieke beperking worden voorgesteld in schoolboeken voor het basisonderwijs. Hiervoor analyseren we afbeeldingen in meer dan 150 boeken van de vijf grootste uitgeverijen van schoolboeken in Vlaanderen. We kijken niet alleen naar de frequentie waarmee bepaalde personages worden afgebeeld en hoe dit overeenkomt met de Vlaamse bevolking, maar ook naar de manier waarop ze worden gepresenteerd. Worden vrouwen bijvoorbeeld vaker afgebeeld terwijl ze huishoudelijke taken uitvoeren dan mannen? Worden personages met een donkere huidskleur vaker in een passieve rol weergegeven? En nemen personages met een fysieke beperking actief deel aan sociale interacties en activiteiten? Daarnaast analyseren we hoe deze boeken thema’s als pesten en discriminatie behandelen. Dit onderzoek combineert een kwantitatieve en kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse van schoolboeken Nederlands, Wiskunde en Wereldoriëntatie uit het 1e (groep 3), 3e (groep 5) en 6e leerjaar (groep 8) van het lager onderwijs.","Samenvatting: In this paper, we examine how access to Surinamese education has developed over approximately 40 years, as evidenced by a cohort comparison of individuals born between 1945 and 1990, who were in education between approximately 1960 and 2010. As in other countries, Suriname has experienced a continuous increase in education levels. Like in other countries, this educational expansion has been more pronounced for women than for men. In the most recent cohort, women, on average, have achieved an education level equivalent to that of men. Regarding ethnic groups, there has been significant convergence in educational outcomes: the groups at the bottom of the hierarchy have caught up with those at the top. However, Maroons and Indigenous people still lag behind other ethnic groups in the most recent cohort. The most remarkable development has been among Javanese women, who have experienced the strongest growth of all the groups studied.\r\nNext, we explore how socio-economic backgrounds (measured by education and occupations of both parents) influence access to education. In Suriname, inequality in educational outcomes based on socio-economic status (SES) is also significant. At first glance, the differences in influence between parents with lower and higher status seem to decrease in younger cohorts, but this trend almost disappears when we take into account the convergence in educational outcomes between ethnic groups. A possible explanation for the persistence of unequal educational opportunities based on socio-economic background is that in Suriname's education system, the least educated and the most educated still remain very far apart.\r\n","Samenvatting: De arbeidsmarktparticipatie van statushouders in met name Noord Nederland blijft achter. Eén oorzaak hiervan is dat werkgevers contracten vaak niet verlengen vanwege een gebrekkige ‘person-job’ en/of ‘person-organization fit'. We presenteren ons door ZonMw gefinancierde co-creatie project, met als focus gemeentelijke professionals die de cruciale schakel vormen in het ‘matchen’ van statushouders en werkgevers. We laten zien hoe we samen met werkgevers, gemeenten en statushouders in de arbeidsmarktregio Groningen en Noord-Drenthe werken aan de duurzame en passende arbeidsmarktparticipatie van statushouders door het faciliteren van een goede ‘match’ tussen statushouder en werkgever. Dit doen wij via de gezamenlijke ontwikkeling van twee evidence-and theory-based interventies voor gemeentelijke professionals: een training en toolbox. We gaan met name in op de vertaling van theoretische inzichten (person-organization fit en job-organization fit) naar een digitale toolbox met daarin concrete handvatten die gemeentelijke arbeidsbemiddelaars kunnen inzetten om werkgevers\r\n· te informeren over het aannemen van statushouders\r\n· te faciliteren bij maken van een goede ‘fit’ \r\n· voor te bereiden op een startende statushouder in hun organisatie.\r\n","Samenvatting: In januari 2022 trad de nieuwe Wet inburgering in werking, als reactie op tekortkomingen uit de vorige wet. Binnen deze nieuwe wet kregen gemeenten opnieuw de verantwoordelijkheid voor het aanbod en de monitoring van de inburgeringstrajecten. Ook zijn er voortaan drie mogelijke ‘routes’ naar inburgering, om beter aan te sluiten bij de capaciteiten en behoeften van nieuwkomers.  \r\nDe wet is ingestoken als ‘lerend en adaptief’. Dit betekent dat de opzet en uitvoering veranderd kan worden als daar aanleiding toe is. Tegen die achtergrond doen we in Rotterdam vier jaar lang (2022-2026) onderzoek naar de opzet, uitvoering en resultaten van het nieuwe inburgeringsbeleid.  \r\nAfgelopen onderzoeksperiode (2023-2024) deden we aan de hand van interviews, observaties en focusgroepen uitgebreid onderzoek onder inburgeraars en professionals. De verzamelde data toont het aanpassingsvermogen en de betrokkenheid van uitvoerders in Rotterdam. We zien dat maatwerk steeds meer mogelijk is maar in de praktijk ook grenzen blijft kennen. Hetzelfde geldt voor de Vroege Start. De combinatie van taal leren en participatie blijft voor alle betrokken een grote uitdaging. Daarnaast loopt men tegen praktische knelpunten aan, zoals het gebrek aan kinderopvang, spreekkamers en (gekwalificeerde) docenten. De wet, en daarmee de mogelijkheden van de gemeente, zijn bovendien een stuk beperkter voor gezinsmigranten.  \r\nDeze bevindingen vragen aandacht van de nationale en lokale overheden, maar bieden ook aanknopingspunten voor het bestuderen en verbeteren van (inburgerings-)beleid in andere gemeenten.","Samenvatting: Spreidingsbeleid dat statushouders proportioneel verdeelt over verschillende regio's binnen een land, blijkt te leiden tot ongelijkheid in de arbeidsmarktkansen van vluchtelingen. Statushouders die – buiten hun eigen schuld – worden geplaatst in regio's met hogere werkloosheidspercentages, hebben minder kans om werk te vinden. Omdat de meeste onderzoeken deze ongelijkheid op één moment in de tijd bestuderen, weten we nog maar weinig over hoe deze ongelijkheid zich in de loop der tijd ontwikkelt. Er bestaan concurrerende theorieën over hoe deze ongelijkheid zich in de tijd zou kunnen ontwikkelen. Theorieën over cumulative advantage suggereren dat ongelijkheid in de loop der tijd zal toenemen terwijl meritocratie-theorieën juist suggereren dat ongelijkheid na verloop van tijd zal afnemen. We gebruiken longitudinale survey- en registergegevens van een grote en representatieve groep Syrische statushouders in Nederland om dit te onderzoeken. De quasi-willekeurige plaatsing van statushouders in Nederland vormt een natuurlijk experiment om causale effecten vast te stellen. Dit gecombineerd met de rijke longitudinale gegevens, stelt ons in staat om de lange-termijn causale effecten van de plaatsingsregio van statushouders op hun arbeidsparticipatie te onderzoeken. De resultaten laten zien dat de plaatsingsregio aanvankelijk weinig invloed heeft, maar dat deze na verloop van tijd toeneemt en een piek bereikt circa drie jaar na huisvesting, waarna de invloed weer geleidelijk afneemt. Al met al vinden we een negatieve invloed van plaatsing in een regio met hogere werkloosheidspercentages gedurende bijna de gehele observatieperiode van zeven jaar. Dit suggereert dat er lange-termijn ongelijkheid bestaat onder statushouders gebaseerd op hun quasi-willekeurig toegewezen plaatsingsregio.","Samenvatting: In Nederland zijn statushouders verplicht om een inburgeringstraject te volgen. Het leren van de Nederlandse taal staat hier centraal. Voor veel statushouders is het leren van het Nederlands meer dan alleen een vereiste: het is de sleutel tot sociale en economische zelfredzaamheid, persoonlijke vrijheid en een gevoel van erbij horen. Onderzoek onder vluchtelingen laat echter een verontrustende trend zien: hoewel velen in de beginperiode aanzienlijke verbeteringen doormaken, stagneert na afronding van de inburgering – meestal na drie jaar – de verbeteringen in de Nederlandse taalbeheersing. Hierdoor blijft het taalniveau achter, hetgeen participatie op de arbeidsmarkt belemmert. Dit roept vragen op over hoe vluchtelingen het beste kunnen worden ondersteund bij hun taalverwerving. Deze studie gebruikt drie waves van enquêtegegevens (2017, 2019, 2022) om de factoren te onderzoeken die de verwerving van de Nederlandse taal beïnvloeden onder Syrische Nederlanders die als vluchteling naar Nederland kwamen. We streven ernaar een genuanceerder perspectief te bieden op de factoren die de paden van vluchtelingen naar zelfredzaamheid vormgeven, door de structurele factoren van inburgerings- en vestigingsbeleid te onderzoeken naast individuele kenmerken. Ons gesegmenteerde mixed-effects model legt zowel kortetermijn- als langetermijndynamiek vast, en biedt inzicht in de complexe dynamiek van taalverwerving in de loop van de tijd. Dit onderzoek stelt het idee van een lineair taalontwikkelingsproces ter discussie, terwijl het kritisch ingaat op de structurele factoren, waaronder het inburgeringsbeleid, die de taalontwikkeling van vluchtelingen beïnvloeden.  \r\n\r\n","Samenvatting: Statushouders hebben een aanzienlijk lagere arbeidsparticipatie en zijn vaker langdurig afhankelijk van de bijstand dan andere bevolkingsgroepen. Dit verhoogt het risico op sociale uitsluiting, verlaagt hun eigenwaarde en draagt bij aan de depreciatie van hun menselijk kapitaal. Hoewel er veel onderzoek is gedaan naar bijstandsafhankelijkheid onder statushouders, ligt de nadruk in bestaand onderzoek veelal op verklaringen op het niveau van individuen of huishoudens. Hierdoor blijft de rol van het op vluchtelingen gericht beleid  op de uitstroom onderbelicht, terwijl statushouders juist aan het begin van hun verblijf in Nederland geconfronteerd worden met dit beleid.  \r\nIn dit onderzoek analyseren we hoe het opvang- en inburgeringsbeleid de duur van bijstandsafhankelijkheid beïnvloeden. We richten ons daarbij specifiek op uitstroom naar werk. Ons onderzoek belicht de invloed van verhuizingen tussen opvanglocaties, verblijfsduur in opvanglocaties, het afronden van de inburgering en het inburgeringsniveau op de kans om de transitie van bijstand naar werk te maken. We onderzoeken ook of en in hoeverre de effecten van deze beleidsfactoren veranderen naarmate de tijd die verstrijkt sinds hun huisvesting, en of de effecten verschillen tussen mannen en vrouwen. \r\nWe analyseren CBS-registerdata van ongeveer 100.000 statushouders die tussen 2014 en 2022 een verblijfsvergunning ontvingen. Voor deze studie maken we gebruik van discrete-tijd-duuranalyse geschat met van multilevel lineaire waarschijnlijkheidsmodellen.","Samenvatting: Translation of science to a general public is increasingly important in modern academia. Yet, there is little knowledge on whether and why scientists do so. Here, we provide an account of a population of German social science professors (N = 2,207). We ask whether and to what extent scientists appear in German printed media (N = 26,729) as a result of cumulative advantage, reputation, and gender. We uniquely link bibliometric data on professors’ careers and data on their appearances in printed media through unique, principled crosswalks of different databases using natural language processing. Departing from the literature on inequality in science, we develop hypotheses on how reputation, cumulative advantage, and gender relate to professors’ media appearances. Employing a series of longitudinal logistic and linear regression analyses we find support for the majority of our conjectures. Professors’ reputation and, in particular, cumulative advantages positively relate to newspaper appearances. Once a scientist has been mentioned in the media they seem “short-listed”. Men have a higher frequency of newspaper appearances than women, which seems driven by men more likely to be top mediagenic professors. Finally, the associations between reputation, cumulative advantage, and the number of media appearances are stronger for men than for women. We discuss the implications of these results for media practice and science evaluation.","Samenvatting: Economic hardship is a well-established determinant of stress and adverse health outcomes. However, its relationship with loneliness—an issue of growing concern at both individual and societal levels—remains insufficiently understood. This study systematically reviews and synthesizes previous research, with a particular focus on factors that either exacerbate or mitigate the impact of economic hardship on loneliness.  \r\nFollowing a comprehensive screening process, 280 predominantly quantitative studies were included in the review. The majority of these studies report a significant association between economic hardship and loneliness, though the strength of this relationship varies considerably. Several contextual and structural factors contribute to this variation.  \r\nSocial integration emerges as a key moderating factor, as individuals who maintain connections within work, household, neighborhood, and voluntary associations are less vulnerable to the adverse effects of economic hardship. Conversely, social comparisons within one's network play a crucial role; individuals who perceive a substantial financial disparity between themselves and their peers are more likely to experience loneliness. Additionally, governmental support mechanisms—particularly policies aimed at alleviating financial distress—may buffer the effects of economic hardship, although this area remains underexplored.  \r\nThis study advances the literature by proposing a model that situates coping processes within a broader social framework, recognizing that coping mechanisms operate not only at the individual level but also within meso- and macro-level structures. Future research should employ this model to examine coping as a socially embedded process, extending beyond individual adaptation to incorporate structural and contextual influences.  \r\n","Samenvatting: Proficiency of the Dutch language plays a pivotal role at the start of the school career of children. Children who are not exposed to the Dutch language at home start their primary education with a disadvantage, which may negatively affect their school performance. It is of great societal importance to gain insight into the factors influencing language proficiency of second generation children of whom both parents were not born in the Netherlands. Using the whole population network database from Statistics Netherlands, this paper investigates to what extent isolation – the exposure of a child to their own origin group in the network – influences their Dutch language proficiency. In addition, the importance of isolation in different layers of the network as well as exposure through direct and indirect contacts is investigated. Results show that for children whose parents are both born abroad a higher share of people from the own origin group in the network is related to a lower score on the language section of the final-year primary school exam. Both direct and indirect contacts of the classmate and family layer of the network play a major role in exposure, in addition to direct contacts of the neighbour network and the indirect contacts of the household member network. This research concludes that exposure - or a lack of exposure – to the Dutch language through various parts of the personal network affects language proficiency of primary school students.","Samenvatting: Decades of sociological research have extensively examined the determinants of socioeconomic outcomes, emphasizing the role of luck, genetics, and social contexts such as families, schools, or neighborhoods. However, determining their importance is challenging because individuals are embedded in complex networks of these social contexts, which interact with each other and with individual characteristics to constrain or facilitate opportunities.\r\nHere, we assess how administrative data from the CBS on the social contexts of children at age 12 (before tracking into secondary schools) is able to predict educational attainment at age 25. To model the myriad interactions between networks of social contexts and individual characteristics, we use statistical models of increasing complexity, from linear models to graph neural networks---an innovative model that directly uses the entire network of social contexts.\r\nWe find that educational attainment at age 12 is well predicted by variables from nuclear families, while extended families, schools, and neighborhoods play relatively minor roles in aggregated. Importantly, our approach uncovers a large heterogeneity in the interactions between different social contexts, and examining these interactions through the lens of sociological theory will either support certain theories or prompt us to revise them to explain the contradictory findings.","Samenvatting: Community Energy Initiatives (CEIs) are crucial for an inclusive energy transition, yet many fail to attract sufficient participants and are biased toward citizens with higher socioeconomic status. This pitfall stems from policies focusing predominantly on individual psychological traits, neglecting social network and community-level characteristics. To overcome this gap, we use network and survey data from a Dutch village and combine common survey methods with social network analysis (SNA) to design targeted intervention strategies.\r\nTo do so, we investigate the local network structure and the embededness of the CEI at hand. Further, we calibrated threshold models of diffusion with the case data to test different intervention/seeding strategies. Participation in CEIs was modeled as a social behavior based not only on individual characteristics, but also on social susceptibility (SS) of the behavior at hand. This yields diffusion models that simulated the adoption of CEI participation throughout the local network over time.\r\nThree intervention strategies were tested: random seeding, central-node seeding, and subcluster-central seeding under three scenarios of increasing SS. Simulations revealed that random seeding, though commonly employed, yields unpredictable outcomes under high SS. In contrast, strategies targeting central nodes or subcluster cores achieved better diffusion and reduced uncertainty regardless of SS scenarios.\r\nFindings were implemented by CEI initiators and have broader implications for collective action and diffusion of innovation in the context of the energy transition. Further, our approach raises questions about threshold scenario realism and cross-case intervention efficacy, laying the groundwork for future research on social influence and calibrated simulations.\r\n","Samenvatting: The Dutch climate movement is one of the most successful national climate movements worldwide. However, it features a unique structure: its largest social movement organization (SMO), Extinction Rebellion (XR), is also its most radical one, coexisting with other NGOs and grassroots groups. Based on interviews with 29 activists, in this article we investigate the activists’ perception of the intergroup dynamics in the movement, particularly in light of the of differences in their SMOs’ radicalness. We identify three themes. Firstly, the activists positioned XR as central to the Dutch movement, hailing its disruptive tactics as key to the movement’s success and its radicalness as useful in legitimising other SMOs and the movement. Secondly, however, XR’s impact was only perceived as possible by the complementarity present in the movement. The SMOs’ differences created different entry points for newcomers, and enabled complementarity when fighting common targets and in collaborating. Finally, activists balanced the immediate success of their own SMO versus that of the broader movement. At times, they chose to prioritise the movement at the expense of their own SMO’s immediate gains, while at others, they saw strengthening their SMO as crucial for the movement’s long-term success. By detailing activists’ perceptions of the movement’s intergroup dynamics, this article theoretically contributes to the radical flank effect, illuminating the dynamics of a case where, rather than a fringe group, the radical flank is the movement’s central force. These novel insights can have practical implications for activists organising in other multi-SMO movements.","Samenvatting: Urban green spaces (UGS) are gaining attention for their positive effects on climate adaptation, biodiversity and (mental) health: they benefit air quality, temperatures, stimulate physical movement, reduce stress and contribute to public familiarity and social cohesion. \r\nAt the same time, concerns rise about UGS in relation to inequality and injustice. Predominantly focussing on the unequal distribution of, and access to UGS, public authorities tend to see the introduction of UGS mostly as an implementation challenge. However, scholars also address procedural and recognitive justice related to the involvement of local communities and the acknowledgement and representation of diverse needs and wishes, as the perspectives of residents of targeted neighbourhoods are often overlooked. \r\nThis qualitative research, using in-depth interviews, therefore focusses on the meanings inhabitants of South-Rotterdam attribute to urban green(ing), and their (non-)participation in greening initiatives. This study reveals the diversity and complexity of the sense-making residents develop to urban nature and the importance of adjusting UGS and greening efforts to local lived environments. Gaining empirically grounded insights into how citizens make sense of inclusive UGS and greening initiatives is crucial in the context of a municipality focusing on participatory UGS against a background of high levels of poverty, stigmatization, and distrust in institutions.","Samenvatting: Onderzoek naar duurzame consumptie toonde herhaaldelijk een ‘attitude-behaviour paradox’ (ABP): mensen vinden duurzaamheid belangrijk, maar vertalen dit niet consequent in duurzaam gedrag. Tegen die achtergrond onderzoekt dit artikel verantwoordingsstrategieën rond consumptiekeuzes bij leden van de middenklasse. \r\nEen thematische analyse van 20 diepte-interviews rond kleding, huisvesting, transport en voeding onthult drie verantwoordingsstrategieën. Ten eerste beroepen respondenten zich op een gevoel van ‘entitlement’ bij niet-duurzame praktijken door deze te framen als essentieel voor hun ‘zelfontplooiing’ en ‘zelfexpressie’. Ten tweede hanteren zij een ‘conscious-awareness’-logica waar men duidelijk ‘grenzen’ stelt aan duurzaamheidsinspanningen om het haalbaar te houden. De ‘bewuste’ keuze laat hen toe niet-duurzame keuzes als verantwoord te zien. Beide strategieën tonen dat een ecologische houding niet altijd samenvalt met de bereidheid comfort en verlangens op te geven. Dit leidt naar een derde strategie: compensatie. Omdat (1) respondenten niet bereid zijn bepaalde gedragingen op te geven, (2) ze over de middelen beschikken om aanpassingen te doen, en (3) duurzaamheid inherent multidimensionaal is, compenseren ze niet-duurzame keuzes door op andere vlakken wél duurzaam te handelen. Sommige consumptiepatronen zijn zo fundamenteel voor de ‘voracious’ middenklasse dat ze niet ter discussie staan, zelfs niet in naam van duurzaamheid. Dit uit zich vooral binnen het domein ‘transport’, en met name reizen.\r\nTheoretisch suggereert dit dat de ABP mogelijk niet bestaat voor deze respondenten. Onze bevindingen tonen bovendien aan dat de respondenten op een zeer ‘klassengebonden’ wijze omgaan met duurzaamheid waarbij beschikbare middelen en typische middenklasse waarden een cruciale rol spelen.","Samenvatting: Notwithstanding the generally disadvantaged position of women in the labour market in the past, there have always been some women who were exceptionally successful. Because they were a small minority – most women who worked did so in low status occupations – they hardly appear in representative datasets and therefore have been rarely studied. In this paper we combine biographical data on successful Dutch women born in the 19th century with a representative sample of working women from the same period. We ask the question: what made that some women attained much higher occupational status than the average woman?\r\nThe biographical data are from the Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland, from which we select women born in the Netherlands between 1849 and 1922. The population data are from the Historical Sample of the Netherlands which contains life course data from a series of administrative records for a similar period. Analyses show that not only father’s occupational status was an important predictor for women’s success in the labor market, but also mother’s status and partner’s status. Women who didn’t marry and didn’t have children, were more likely to reach a high status as well. High-status women seem to be less affected by parental resources than low-status women.\r\n","Samenvatting: Inequality of educational opportunity and its trend over time is one of the most prominent policy concerns in Western countries. Inequality of educational opportunity can be defined as a situation where children with similar innate capabilities have different educational outcomes as a result of their different (socio-economic) circumstances, which contributes to social stratification. Intergenerational transmission of education is often used as an indicator of inequality of opportunity. However, shared genes are a major source of resemblance between parents and children, and studies on intergenerational transmission are unable to distinguish between genetic effects and influence of the family environment. Twin studies are designed to parse out the effects of genes versus the shared environment by making use of the difference in genetic relatedness of monozygotic versus dizygotic twins. The current study uses population-wide data on twins and siblings of Dutch origin, birth cohorts 1964-1997, from integral registers of Statistics Netherlands. We assess trends in genetic influence (‘heritability’) and the influence of the shared environment on educational attainment in the Netherlands. We adapt the classical twin design to estimate heritability in the absence of information on zygosity. Over these thirty-four years heritability of educational attainment increased and the influence of the shared environment decreased. Hence, educational attainment has become increasingly determined by innate capabilities, which strongly suggests a decrease in inequality of opportunity in these birth cohorts of Dutch origin. This study contributes to insight in contemporary patterns of stratification. Future research should focus on younger cohorts and non-Dutch origin groups.","Samenvatting: Cultural capital comprises a declarative (conscious) and a non-declarative (unconscious) aspect, with the latter considered crucial in everyday health-related choices. Yet, extant quantitative research into the relationship between cultural capital and health-related outcomes has only been able to investigate the declarative aspect of cultural capital. The current study aims to overcome this limitation by implementing a novel methodology to measure non-declarative cultural capital empirically and exploring to what extent it 1) associates with nutritional practices and 2) mediates the relationship between (parental) socioeconomic position and these practices.\r\nThe study draws upon a recently developed analytical tool using two Implicit Association Tests (IATs): one IAT measuring the appreciation of elite over common cultural expressions, and one IAT measuring self-identification with elite over common cultural expressions. These were embedded in a survey fielded among members of a high-quality panel drawn randomly from the official Dutch population register (n = 2,436), which also includes a short food frequency questionnaire.\r\nWe find that both declarative and non-declarative cultural capital are independently associated with adherence to dietary guidelines, and partly contribute to the relationship between educational attainment and adherence to dietary guidelines. This provides the first empirical validation of the widely assumed relationship between non-declarative cultural and food-related practices, while also highlighting that both declarative and non-declarative cultural capital are relevant for understanding (socially stratified patterns in) food-related practices."]},{"id":"Ronde","name":"Ronde","type":"numeric","minWidth":60,"align":"left"},{"id":"Sessie","name":"Sessie","type":"character"},{"id":"Zaal","name":"Zaal","type":"character","maxWidth":80,"align":"left"},{"id":"Spreker","name":"Spreker","type":"character"},{"id":"Coauteur(s)","name":"Coauteur(s)","type":"character"},{"id":"Taal","name":"Taal","type":"character","maxWidth":60,"align":"left"},{"id":"Titel","name":"Titel","type":"character","html":true,"minWidth":250},{"id":"samenvatting_paper","name":"samenvatting_paper","type":"character","show":false}],"filterable":true,"searchable":true,"defaultPageSize":10,"showPageSizeOptions":true,"pageSizeOptions":[4,10,50,100,200],"showPagination":true,"onClick":"expand","highlight":true,"rowStyle":{"cursor":"pointer"},"dataKey":"57142942b1374d438428bf57abc680b5"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
